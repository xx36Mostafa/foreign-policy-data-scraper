                    "post_content": "U.S. President Joe Biden laid out a new Israeli proposal for a hostage and cease-fire agreement with Hamas on Friday, describing it as a \u201croad map\u201d to an \u201cenduring cease-fire\u201d in Gaza that would secure the release of some 128 hostages that remain in Hamas captivity.\u00a0 Speaking from the White House, Biden gave one of the most detailed outlines of a proposed deal to date in an effort to pressure both Hamas and far-right members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government to accept the agreement. Negotiators from the United States, Qatar, and Egypt have sought for months, without avail, to strike a deal between Israel and the militant group to secure a pause in fighting and the release of the remaining hostages. \u201cEveryone who wants peace now must raise their voices and let the leaders know they should take this deal,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWork to make it real, make it lasting, and forge a better future out of the tragic terror attack and war,\u201d he added.\u00a0 Qatar transmitted the four-and-a-half page proposal to Hamas on Thursday, according to a senior Biden administration official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity under terms set by the White House. The first phase of the Israeli proposal would see a six week cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas of Gaza. It would also allow for Palestinian civilians to return to their homes across the enclave, including in the north. This would be accompanied by a surge in humanitarian aid of at least 600 trucks per day\u2014the number that U.S. officials have assessed is required to adequately tackle the threat of famine\u2014as well as the delivery of hundreds of thousands of temporary shelters, including housing units.\u00a0 The first stage in the deal would also see the release of a number of Israeli hostages, including women, the elderly, and the wounded in exchange for \u201chundreds\u201d of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, according to Biden.\u00a0 During the six week cease-fire, Israel and Hamas would continue to negotiate on phase two of the proposed deal, which would entail a permanent end to the war and the release of all remaining hostages, including male soldiers, and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.\u00a0 Biden acknowledged that there were a number of details that still need to be agreed to in order to move from phase one to phase two, but he noted that under the terms of the deal, the temporary cease-fire would remain in place beyond six weeks\u2014as long as negotiations continued.\u00a0 \u201cThe people of Israel should know, they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they\u2019ve devastated Hamas forces over the past eight months,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAt this point, Hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another Oct. 7,\u201d he added, describing Israel\u2019s principal war objective as a \u201crighteous\u201d one. The final stage of the agreement includes the return of the remains of dead hostages and outlines steps for the post-war stabilization and reconstruction of Gaza, where some 370,000 homes have been damaged and almost 80,000 destroyed, according to a United Nations report released at the beginning of May.\u00a0 The proposal is \u201cextremely close in almost every respect\u201d to the kind of agreement that Hamas indicated it would be willing to accept in previous failed rounds of negotiations, the senior administration official said. Hamas officials have previously insisted that any cease-fire agreements must be permanent. Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said in a statement after Biden\u2019s speech that the group viewed the president\u2019s remarks \u201cpositively\u201d and indicated that it was willing to work with any proposal that included a \u201cpermanent ceasefire\u201d as well as Israel\u2019s military withdrawal from Gaza, provisions on reconstruction and the return of civilians to their homes, and a \u201cprisoner exchange\u201d deal. In the face of rising international condemnation over the spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza and domestic pressure to secure the release of hostages, Netanyahu is likely more inclined than ever to try to strike a deal, said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East peace negotiator for the U.S. State Department.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s got to demonstrate that something has been achieved,\u201d he said. Netanyahu\u2019s office issued a statement on Friday following Biden\u2019s announcement, saying that the \u201cGovernment of Israel is united in its desire to return the hostages as soon as possible and is working to achieve this goal.\u201d \u201cThe Prime Minister authorized the negotiating team to present a proposal to that end, which would also enable Israel to continue the war until all its objectives are achieved, including the destruction of Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities,\u201d the statement added.",

                    "post_content": "Matt Kroenig: Hi, Emma. Last weekend was Memorial Day and the unofficial start of summer. I assume you are spending your days sunning by the pool? Emma Ashford: Oh, if only. It\u2019s so swampy here in D.C. that it\u2019s hard to be productive even when we\u2019re meant to be working. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Biden administration finds it so hard to solve any big foreign-policy problems? MK: You mean the major ongoing wars in Europe and the Middle East? Yes, I would say those are big problems. I remember the good ol\u2019 days, 15 years ago, when we only worried about counterinsurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan and Iran\u2019s advancing enrichment program. Should we start with the war in Gaza? EA: Unfortunately, yes. Three big topics I think we need to address here. First, the Israeli military has now pushed into Rafah, which U.S. President Joe Biden had previously said was his \u201cred line.\u201d Now the administration is frantically backpedaling, arguing that this isn\u2019t a major or large-scale incursion and so isn\u2019t a violation. Biden\u2019s red line keeps moving west and south inside Gaza as the Israelis advance; at this rate, pretty soon his red line will be the Egyptian border. But with significant violence in Rafah and constant news of civilian deaths, it\u2019s hard to see how long the Biden administration can keep this up. There was a strong outcry after an Israeli strike on refugee tents a few days back caused a massive fire and killed around 45 civilians, including children. How long can Israel really expect to keep this up? I\u2019d say world opinion has turned pretty firmly against it. MK: To paraphrase Stalin, how many divisions does world opinion have? I don\u2019t think bad press is going to stop Israel from waging its war against Hamas. I think there are a lot of unfair criticisms of Israel\u2019s war effort. But I do think there are several fair criticisms. First, the Israelis have not laid out a plan for rebuilding and governing Gaza after the war is over. Second, despite repeated requests, they haven\u2019t provided a plan for how they will both eliminate Hamas and protect innocent civilians in Rafah. And third, they failed to hold northern Gaza after clearing it, and now Hamas is resurfacing there. Despite what the International Criminal Court (ICC) might say, it is not a war crime, but it is bad strategy. EA: It\u2019s really notable how the exact problems people pointed out back in October of last year\u2014that Israel should not invade Gaza without a plan for postwar governance or a plan for protecting civilians\u2014are the things that are clearly hurting the Israelis now. And it\u2019s utterly damning on the part of the Netanyahu government that it apparently still does not actually have a strategy for either of these problems! But it does seem that the Biden administration, despite repeatedly pointing this out, seems to have had little impact on the Israeli government. It\u2019s not even doing a good job of making sure that U.S. weapons are used in a responsible and ethical way. You ask how many divisions public opinion has? None, but the U.S. military certainly has many. The Israeli military routinely uses 2,000-pound bombs that are devastating in densely populated areas and the attack on Rafah came after the Biden administration has promised to stop sending certain weapons to Israel. Certain munitions are fundamentally unsuited to urban combat of the kind seen in Gaza because of how it hurts civilians. Why aren\u2019t U.S. officials applying more pressure here\u2014beyond Biden suggesting a cease-fire in a speech? MK: The Biden administration\u2019s approach is muddled. It is trying to have it both ways, as you point out, drawing and then moving red lines, and in the process it is angering both Israel\u2019s supporters and its critics. Israel\u2019s supporters are outraged that the White House is threatening to withhold aid to an ally fighting a war against a dangerous terrorist adversary. And Israel\u2019s critics are outraged that the White House is continuing to support Israel\u2019s war effort even as the casualties mount in Gaza. EA: I understand it\u2019s difficult in an election year, but it can\u2019t have it both ways. To be frank, Biden is at risk of alienating both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian voters with this middle-of-the-road approach. No one is happy, and it\u2019s certainly not good for U.S. strategic interests, either. Another problem has been the completely incompetent aid plans put in place by the administration. The newly built Gaza pier, designed to deliver aid to civilians, has apparently broken apart and is drifting out to sea. The whole thing was a PR stunt to help the administration cover for the fact that Israel isn\u2019t letting enough humanitarian aid into the conflict\u2014and now it has backfired while making the United States look incompetent. Israel now has control of all of Gaza\u2019s land borders, meaning that any aid has got to come through it. MK: We seem to be agreeing too much this week, but I agree. Both of these problems have the same source: making national security decisions to placate public opinion. The job of leaders is to determine what is in the best interests of the country and then make the case to the American people, not bend the strategy according to the public mood. Biden\u2019s initial instincts were correct right after Oct. 7, to have Israel\u2019s back in its war against Hamas. But with an eye to the election calendar, the administration has produced a confusing and ultimately ineffective strategy. In other words, Biden is right to demand that Israel produce a viable strategy to defeat a dangerous terrorist group consistent with the law of armed conflict, but he is wrong to demand that Israel act in order to appease low-information voters in Michigan. EA: Yikes, well, perhaps the fact we agree here should be a sign that the Biden administration really needs to shift course to something\u2014literally anything\u2014more effective. I know what we\u2019ll disagree on! The ICC recently announced that it is seeking arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for crimes against humanity in Gaza, and against three Hamas leaders for the atrocities of Oct. 7. That implies it has some credible evidence of war crimes and is now seeking warrants, similar to the one the ICC issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year. MK: You are right. We disagree. It is outrageous to suggest a moral or legal equivalence between Hamas and Israel, as the Biden administration has also argued. Hamas is a terrorist group whose driving purpose is to slaughter innocent Israeli civilians, as we saw in brutal fashion on Oct. 7. Israel is a democracy that scrupulously follows the law of armed conflict. The ICC\u2019s flimsy case rests largely on the charge that Israel is intentionally starving a civilian population as a method of warfare. If true, then the Israelis are pretty incompetent in executing this strategy given that they have facilitated the delivery significant amounts of aid since the war began. Moreover, Israel is not a member of the ICC, so, as the U.S. government also argues, the ICC has no legal jurisdiction over this matter. Israel has its own effective judicial system and can prosecute any illegal actions taken by its service members as it has done in the past. But these flimsy charges do not deserve a hearing. The better debate is whether Republicans in Congress are right to want to sanction the ICC over this ridiculous charge. EA: Why start with sanctions? Why not jump straight to the Hague Invasion Act? Look, the U.S. relationship with the ICC has always been fraught, as the very existence of the Hague Invasion Act implies. You\u2019re right that, legally speaking, the ICC probably has no jurisdiction here. But that\u2019s the kind of thing lawyers argue, and I think this is much more a public relations problem than a legal one, both for the United States and for Israel. A few things stand out. First, it seems clear that the ICC has credible evidence of war crimes committed by Israeli forces; proving that that is tied to\u2014or directed by\u2014senior leaders is likely to be much harder, but the existence of atrocities is pretty clear and is something that U.S. policymakers need to consider, if only because they risk violating American domestic laws on selling weapons. Second is the significant public relations problem this poses: Biden has made promises to uphold a liberal international order the central component of his foreign policy. But as H.A. Hellyer pointed out in Foreign Policy recently, \u201cThe breaking of the rules isn\u2019t new\u2014but Washington\u2019s failure to even acknowledge that such violations are even plausibly going on destroys trust in that system on the one hand and demolishes U.S. credibility on the other.\u201d The United States tells other countries they must comply with ICC rulings when they concern Russia or China but refuses to do so when it comes to Israel? If your entire strategy is based on being the \u201cgood guys\u201d in the way that Biden\u2019s strategy is, then sanctioning the ICC will make America look hypocritical and ridiculous\u2014and undermine whatever international norms around conflict do exist. MK: For a realist, you seem overly concerned with \u201cpublic relations\u201d on this issue. And I agree that the United States should not sanction the ICC, but the ICC is often an obstacle to a functioning rules-based system, not a part of it. Upholding a rules-based order does not mean following any and all rules, even those that are counterproductive and that are not embraced by the creators and leaders of the system. A central element of a rules-based system is the need to defend it from those, like terrorist groups, who want to tear it down. This requires enabling the United States and its mostly democratic allies and partners, like Israel, to use force against revisionist autocracies and terrorists. The ICC in this case is being used to prevent the defense of the system. The fear that the ICC would be abused to prosecute Americans for doing the right thing is why there has been long-standing bipartisan opposition to the ICC in the United States. EA: You\u2019re a scholar of Machiavelli; surely you know that part of being a realist is keeping the public happy with your strategy? But perhaps we should turn to the other big crisis that\u2019s bogging down the Biden administration. Things in Ukraine are pretty rough at the moment. The Russians are making small gains, and Ukraine increasingly seems to be struggling even to maintain a defensive strategy. That doesn\u2019t seem to be dissuading Western policymakers from arguing that Ukraine can still defeat Russia and evict it from every inch of Ukrainian territory. Faced with poor performance on the part of the Ukrainian military, these policymakers are now pushing escalation, arguing for Western troops to be deployed to Ukraine in support roles, and for restrictions on weapons usage to be lifted. It sure seems like what realists predicted over the last two years is playing out: Ukraine cannot win a conventional war against a much larger opponent, and Western leaders are tempted to escalate rather than admit that their goals may be too ambitious. MK: I think it teaches a different lesson: The restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s weapons usage never made much sense, and Western leaders are finally coming to that realization. For the past two years, the White House has prohibited Ukraine from using U.S.-supplied weapons to strike into Russian territory\u2014although today\u2019s belated announcement may start to change that. But Russia is massing troops on Ukraine\u2019s border and striking Ukraine from bases inside Russia. Prohibiting Ukraine from hitting back gives Russia a sanctuary from which to attack Ukraine with impunity. It is essentially forcing Ukraine to fight a war with one hand tied behind its back. The White House\u2019s reasoning is that it wants to avoid \u201cescalation\u201d with Russia, but these fears are overblown, and the West is essentially deterring itself. I and many others argued against these restrictions for more than two years. Whether the goal is for Ukraine to fight for a total battlefield victory or to fight to a stalemate along the current line of contact, either way, Kyiv will need to put pressure on Russia by striking military targets in Russia and making Putin feel the pain. EA: In the past week, the Ukrainians used drones to hit a Russian early-warning radar system that forms part of Russia\u2019s ability to detect incoming nuclear ballistic missiles. That\u2019s a profoundly destabilizing choice, and one I would not want to see repeated! I don\u2019t have a particular problem with Ukrainian forces using artillery or shorter-range systems to strike across the border when Russia is massing troops, or to attack supply lines. The ongoing fight at Kharkiv, near the border, is one example of a place where that makes a lot of sense. But many of these long-range strikes have been on facilities that aren\u2019t as important to the Ukrainian war effort, and\u2014like the nuclear radar\u2014may have other, destabilizing consequences, whether that\u2019s in the nuclear space, energy prices, or something else. My bigger concern is that Washington appears to be sleepwalking into escalation because it's unwilling to dial down its war aims. Ukraine is struggling to fight off an attacker that\u2019s much bigger; that\u2019s pretty much what we\u2019d expect. But policymakers in Europe are trying to escalate instead, apparently assuming that if they just send troops behind the lines, or allow long-range strikes, it will somehow magically overcome Ukraine\u2019s natural disadvantages in this fight. It\u2019s foolish. MK: Well, I am glad you agree that Ukraine should be able to strike massing troops and supply lines across the border in Russia. You are more forward-leaning on this issue than the White House. But my disagreement with the analysis from you and the Biden administration is that vagaries like \u201cdestabilizing\u201d and \u201cescalation\u201d are doing all the work in your arguments. What exactly do you fear Russia will do if Ukraine strikes radars or other targets deep inside Russia? I think the answer is not much. Putin does not want escalation with NATO, either. He will continue the war effort in much the same way, but Ukraine will be in a stronger position. EA: This is a really important assumption about the war that I think doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. People assume that there is nothing Putin can do in response to Western escalation without either starting a direct war with NATO or resorting to nuclear use. But that\u2019s completely inaccurate. Just look at the reports from the last few weeks of apparent Russian sabotage efforts in European states! A German munitions plant, warehouses in London that were used to store supplies for Ukraine, etc. Russia has plenty of asymmetric escalation options available before it goes nuclear. Is this really the path the West wants to go down? MK: Russia trying to burn an IKEA in Lithuania is worrisome to be sure, but not significant enough to cause me to rethink Western strategy for the biggest war in Europe since World War II. And the West should deter future such attacks by letting Putin know that if he keeps playing with fire in NATO countries, he is bound to get burned.\u00a0 EA: How is the West going to do that? Escalate in Ukraine? But if they were going to escalate already regardless, then how does threatening that deter Putin? The fundamental problem with U.S. Ukraine strategy\u2014as my colleagues Stephen Wertheim, Josh Shifrinson, and I argued here at Foreign Policy recently\u2014is that Biden has substituted a debate about escalation and assistance to Ukraine for the real questions: What is it that the United States wants to achieve in Ukraine? And is that actually achievable in practice? I would hope that the administration is looking at all of this and questioning whether further escalation is a good idea. I take their caution on long-range strikes inside Russia as a good sign in that context. But as Americans start to edge into election season here in Washington, it\u2019s hard not to escape the impression that the world is on fire and Biden is not responding particularly well to any of it. MK: Indeed, the public opinion polling shows Americans trust former President Donald Trump more than Biden to handle many foreign-policy issues. After all, both Europe and the Middle East were at peace during the Trump administration, but engulfed in war under Biden. I am sure that is an issue we will be debating over the next several months. EA: Sounds like a plan. Making Trump look good by comparison is definitely an achievement\u2014 I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s the achievement the Biden administration was aiming for.",

                    "post_excerpt": "If you\u2019re surprised by the movement\u2019s position, you never really understood it.",
                    "post_content": "At first glance, you might think that foreign-policy realists wouldn\u2019t care one way or the other about what Israel is doing in Gaza. Yes, it\u2019s a humanitarian disaster and possibly a genocide, but is brutal behavior all that rare in the conduct of international politics? Aren\u2019t realists the first to point out that in a world with no central authority, governments are going to take the gloves off if they think they will benefit and that no one will stop them? Consider how the United States reacted after Pearl Harbor or after Sept. 11, how Russia is acting in Ukraine, or how the contending forces are behaving in Sudan, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Yet prominent foreign-policy realists\u2014including Chas Freeman, John Mearsheimer, and yours truly\u2014have been highly critical of Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza and the Biden administration\u2019s support for it. Isn\u2019t it odd that adherents of a hard-nosed and unsentimental approach to world politics are suddenly talking about morality? Nope. Some of the confusion arises from a common misconception about realism; namely, that its proponents think ethical considerations should play little or no role in the conduct of foreign policy. This is a silly charge, as even a casual reading of the realist canon would reveal. Hans J. Morgenthau wrote a whole book exploring the tensions between political efficacy and moral principles, and he emphasized that \u201cthe moral issues [of politics] raise their voice and demand an answer.\u201d E. H. Carr was not a genuine realist, but he did write one classic realist work and made it clear that one could not exclude considerations of morality from political life. Virtually all of Kenneth Waltz\u2019s writings on international politics focus on the problem of peace and the conditions or policies that reinforce or undermine it, and he repeatedly criticized the tendency of powerful states to commit evil acts in the pursuit of idealistic objectives. And prominent realists like George Kennan, Walter Lippmann, Morgenthau, Waltz, and their intellectual descendants opposed many of America\u2019s recent wars of choice, on both strategic and moral grounds. Like all human beings, those of us who think realism provides a useful way to think about world politics also have moral convictions and would like to live in a world where those principles were observed more consistently. Indeed, realists care about the moral dimensions of international politics precisely because they recognize how easy it is for states and other political groups to commit immoral acts. Realists are not surprised by what is happening in Gaza\u2014as noted above, plenty of other states have done horrendous things when they felt their vital interests were at stake\u2014but that hardly means that realists approve of what Israel and the United States are doing. Realists\u2019 criticisms of the war in Gaza arise in part from their appreciation of the limits of military power and the importance of nationalism. They are acutely aware of the difficulties foreign invaders typically face when attempting to dominate or destroy another people with armed force, which is why they concluded that Israel\u2019s attempt to destroy Hamas by bombing and invading Gaza was doomed to fail. It is increasingly clear that Hamas is going to survive Israel\u2019s onslaught, and even if it doesn\u2019t, new resistance organizations are bound to emerge as long as Palestinians are occupied, denied basic political rights, and gradually dispossessed of their lands. Equally important, realists oppose Israel\u2019s actions (and U.S. complicity in them) because the combination is undermining America\u2019s global position. The war in Gaza has made it clear that America\u2019s commitment to a \u201crules-based order\u201d is meaningless; it is frankly hard to believe that U.S. officials can still utter that phrase with a straight face. The recent U.N. General Assembly vote granting new \u201crights and privileges\u201d to Palestine\u2014which passed 143-9 with 25 abstentions\u2014was a revealing indicator of America\u2019s growing isolation, as was the repeated U.S. veto of U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for a cease-fire. The top prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has applied for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity (along with Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri). Washington will no doubt reject this step, further underscoring how out of step it is with much of the world. Public opinion polls also suggest U.S. popularity has declined sharply in the Middle East and slightly in Europe, while support for China, Russia, and Iran has risen. Less than one month into the war, a report from the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy warned: \u201cAmerica\u00a0is\u00a0losing\u00a0compared to\u00a0its opponents\u00a0because of the war\u00a0in Gaza. The percentage of Arabs who believe America has a positive role in the\u00a0war\u00a0amounts only to 7 percent,\u00a0with figures as low as 2 percent in countries like Jordan.\u00a0By\u00a0contrast, the percentage of Arabs who say that China has a positive role\u00a0in the conflict included\u00a046 percent in Egypt, 34 percent in Iraq, and 27 percent in Jordan. \u2026 Moreover, it\u00a0seems that Iran\u00a0has been a major\u00a0beneficiary\u00a0of this war.\u00a0On average,\u00a0percentage of those who say that it had a positive impact in the war\u00a0is\u00a040 percent,\u00a0compared to 21 percent\u00a0[of] those\u00a0who say that it has\u00a0a negative\u00a0impact. In countries such as Egypt and Syria,\u00a0the percentage\u00a0who say that Iran has a positive influence in Gaza\u00a0is even higher, reaching\u00a050 percent and 52 percent\u00a0respectively.\u201d And the war isn\u2019t cheap. The U.S. Congress has authorized billions of dollars of additional aid to help Israel decimate Gaza, along with $320 million for that floating pier the United States had to construct because the \u201cally\u201d we are backing wouldn\u2019t let relief agencies send trucks in to deliver humanitarian aid. U.S. military forces have been using up expensive missiles and bombs against the Houthis in Yemen, who began to terrorize ships in and around the Red Sea in protest to what Israel is doing. I know: These amounts aren\u2019t that much for a country with a $25 trillion economy, but it would be nice to spend this money helping Americans instead of helping kill Palestinians in Gaza. The next time congressional budget hawks say they must cut some domestic programs, remind them how eager they were to pay for Israel\u2019s war. The war is also burning up vast amounts of top officials\u2019 time, energy, and attention. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and CIA Director William Burns have made repeated trips to the region and spent countless hours wrestling with these issues. So have other top officials, including President Joe Biden himself. The time U.S. leaders have devoted to a conflict between roughly 15 million people in Israel and Palestine is time that they could not spend visiting key allies elsewhere, devising a better policy in Ukraine, developing an effective economic strategy for Asia, marshaling global support to address climate change, or any number of far more important issues. The big winners? Russia and China, of course. For many people around the world\u2014and especially much of the global south\u2014the carnage in Gaza validates Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s recurring charge that global U.S. \u201cleadership\u201d sows conflict and suffering and that the world would be better off in a multipolar order where power was shared more evenly. You may not agree with that argument, but millions of people already do, and our current policy makes it look a lot more credible. In the meantime, Chinese leaders aren\u2019t wasting their time flying to Israel for the privilege of being humiliated by Netanyahu; they are busy mending fences, cultivating economic connections, and solidifying the \u201cno limits\u201d partnership with Russia. They must be giving thanks every single day for the costly distraction that the war in Gaza has become for the United States. Lastly, realists object to what Israel is doing because it brings the United States precisely zero strategic benefits. Although its value was sometimes exaggerated, during the Cold War one could plausibly argue that Israel was a useful check against Soviet influence in the Middle East. But the Cold War ended more than 30 years ago, and unconditional support for Israel is not making Americans more secure today. Some of Israel\u2019s defenders now claim it is a powerful bulwark against Iran and a valuable partner against terror; what they fail to mention is that our relationship with Israel is one of the reasons the United States has a bad relationship with Iran and one of the reasons that terrorists like al Qaeda decided to attack the United States. The plain fact is that bombing Gaza back to the Stone Age is not going to make Americans safer or more prosperous, and it is totally at odds with the values that Americans like to proclaim. If anything, it might make the United States slightly less secure, if it inspires a new generation of anti-American terrorists like the late Osama bin Laden. Nor is this policy going to make Israel safer; only a political solution to the conflict can do that. And that\u2019s why realists like me shake our heads about what the United States and Israel are doing today. On some rare and wonderful occasions, states can pursue a policy that advances their strategic interests and their moral preferences simultaneously. At other times, they face trade-offs between the two and must make hard choices between them (typically in favor of the former). But in this case, the United States is actively undermining its strategic interests and supporting the mass killing of innocent people, largely because U.S. leaders are trapped in an outdated view of the conflict and are overly deferential to a powerful interest group. For any good realist, doing evil for no good purpose is the worst sin of all.",

                    "post_content": "Amid all the attempts to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas and the furor over the ongoing demonstrations at U.S. college campuses, the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip remains dire. More than 75 percent of Gaza\u2019s population, or 1.7 million people, is displaced. A majority of all buildings are destroyed. Clean water is scarce. More than a million Palestinians in Gaza face what the World Food Program is calling \u201ccatastrophic levels of hunger.\u201d If that develops into a famine, it would dramatically increase the numbers of the dead from the current 34,000. How can these conditions be alleviated? Can famine be staved off? What role can the international community and aid organizations play? I spoke with two experts on the latest edition of FP Live: Sari Bashi, the program director for Human Rights Watch, and Shira Efron, the Israel Policy Forum\u2019s director of research. Bashi joined the program from the West Bank, while Efron was in Tel Aviv. Subscribers can watch the full discussion on the video box atop this page or download the FP Live podcast. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Ravi Agrawal: Sari, I know your in-laws live in Gaza. I\u2019m sorry for what they must be going through. How is the family holding up? Sari Bashi: Like most people in Gaza, my in-laws have been displaced. Early on, they fled the refugee camp in which they lived in northern Gaza. They\u2019ve since been advised that all of their homes have been destroyed. And they\u2019re sheltering in Rafah, near the southern border with Egypt. They\u2019re luckier than some. They\u2019re in a building as opposed to tents, and they are able to access some food and water. But they\u2019re very scared right now. Because one of the concerns about Gaza is that although the Israeli military has been issuing evacuation orders, the places that they tell people to flee to are not actually safe. So, as we hear more reports of a Rafah invasion, that\u2019s a scary proposition. RA: Do you have a sense of what life is like for them? SB: It\u2019s difficult to communicate what life is like there. It\u2019s been six months. It\u2019s constant bombardment, constant uncertainty. People spend most of their days just trying to survive, to get food, medicine, water, to try to manage sanitation, which when you put that many people in such a small area, it\u2019s actually quite dire. How do you get rid of waste when there are so many people cramped together like that? I don\u2019t know that we can fully understand what they\u2019re going through. RA: Shira, how much aid is getting into Gaza right now? My understanding is that Israel and the United Nations differ on the exact numbers, but between 300 and 400 trucks of aid are now going in every day. This is significantly up since the furor over the deaths of seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen about a month ago. But before Oct. 7, about 500 aid trucks were going in daily. Shira Efron: That is correct. Israel\u2019s evolving humanitarian policy has shifted quite dramatically since Oct. 7. And now we are seeing days where the number of trucks even tops 400. There have been significant developments since the World Central Kitchen workers were tragically killed by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. As of [this week], all crossings that were open prior to Oct. 7 are now operational again. There\u2019s Rafah through Egypt, Kerem Shalom, Ashdod Port. The Erez crossing in the north, which was used beforehand mostly for people, is now used for bringing goods in. And there\u2019s the maritime [joint logistics over-the-shore, or JLOTS] pier that the United States is building. And airdrops have been allowed by Israel in larger quantities than before. So we are seeing much more aid coming in. We are also looking at the composition of aid. Fuel was a huge issue before, and now Israel has increased the quantities of fuel to allow for sanitation, wastewater plants, operating bakeries. If we had this conversation two months ago or even a month ago, we would be in a very different situation. Is Israel doing enough? Probably not. Is it too little, too late? Can it repair? It will take us time to see the impacts of the change in policy. But the state of play now is that there\u2019s been remarkable improvement, at least in what Israel allows in. Now, there are a lot of logistical problems in how you distribute this aid and make sure those in need actually get it. And that\u2019s a separate question. SB: I see the situation a little bit differently. I agree that things have gotten better in the past few weeks, but we\u2019re still at a monthly average of just 40 percent of truckloads going in compared to before the war. And we have to remember that the situation is quite different. Before the war, Gaza was engaging in independent food production. Water was being piped in. Electricity was being generated. In other words, the needs were much less. And we are at less than half of that capability for a population that has been suffering from six months of intensive bombardment and destruction of basic infrastructure. So it\u2019s better than it was a few weeks ago. But it\u2019s very far from what we need to stave off famine. The Israeli government is still denying visas to humanitarian aid workers. Last month, they rejected 25 percent of requests to deliver to northern Gaza. I think the most important thing is we haven\u2019t seen a change in the policy of the Israeli government. The Israeli government has been clear that they are using humanitarian aid as a bargaining chip for the return of civilian hostages. It is a war crime to hold those Israeli hostages in Gaza. Hamas and Islamic Jihad need to release them unconditionally and immediately. But that war crime doesn\u2019t justify the war crime that the Israeli authorities are committing of using starvation as a weapon of war. And I have not seen a rollback or a change in that policy. If there were a decision by the Israeli government to abide by its obligations, not just to stop preventing aid but to actively supply the aid as it is required to do as an occupying power that dismantled the ability of the local government to operate, at least in northern Gaza? Then we would see a change. SE: Where I differ from Sari is I think Israeli decision-makers are now terrified. And they understand that they have to change their policy. If there\u2019s one anecdote that illustrates this, the Israeli minister of defense, who on Oct. 9\u2014and he\u2019s quoted in the ICJ [International Court of Justice] order\u2014said there will not be any water or food going to Gaza, stood [this week] next to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Kerem Shalom crossing and said on primetime TV that we are going to increase humanitarian assistance dramatically to Gaza because it\u2019s in our interest. Does Israel do it because it believes it has a moral responsibility? No. Do they do it because they are afraid of international pressure and the ICJ and ICC [International Criminal Court]? Of course. But the fact is that we are seeing a change in policy that, like Sari, I hope will be sustained and expanded. RA: You said Israel\u2019s government now appears terrified. What is terrifying them? SE: First of all, the International Court of Justice, which is deliberating a case. There is the fear of personal accusations of Israeli leaders for committed war crimes. We haven\u2019t heard of that happening, but I know that in the prime minister\u2019s office, there\u2019s a real fear that he personally, but also other senior commanders in the IDF and other politicians, will be accused like Vladimir Putin, like Slobodan Milosevic. RA: Sari, Israel assesses that a famine is not imminent, but aid organizations disagree. SB: It is the assessment of the humanitarian organizations and their workers who are risking their lives in order to actually deliver aid, as well as testimonies from families who are not able to get food. People are using birdseed as food. At least 27 children were reported to have died of malnutrition [as of April]. Human Rights Watch has documented children wasting away, infants dying of dehydration. So the situation is quite dire. The Israeli government knows that. And the Israeli government has been occupying Gaza since 1967. They know exactly what\u2019s going on there. They know how much food is required. They\u2019ve calculated the number of calories that people in Gaza need in order to survive, and they know how to get enough food in there. The International Court of Justice order was that the Israeli government needs to ensure that adequate food gets in. Not try to ensure. The Israeli government knows how to do that. And I agree that they might have been influenced by words from U.S. President Joe Biden. But the United States could do more than words. They could suspend arms transfers to the Israeli military until such time as the Israeli military complies with international law. That would be terrifying. That would lead to a change in policy because I have not seen a decision by the Israeli government to end the policy of starvation as a weapon of war. They know what to do. They can flood Gaza with aid. They can use their troops in northern Gaza to deliver the aid, because they have dismantled the government in northern Gaza. There\u2019s no functioning government. And, notably, in the International Court of Justice, the only Israeli judge, the ad hoc judge who was appointed to the panel, signed on to the provisional order that ordered the Israeli military to ensure that enough aid reached Gaza\u2014ensure, as the obligation of an occupying power that is in control and has the ability and the obligation to make sure the food gets to hungry people. SE: I agree, and this is part of the motivation of Israel. In terms of the IDF itself delivering aid, we can speak a lot about the rapprochement that\u2019s probably needed between Israel and the U.N. all the way up and down. But when you speak with the U.N. folks on the ground and in leadership, they are very principled in terms of how much proximity they\u2019re willing to have with the IDF. Even in response to the JLOTS, the U.N. has initially said that they would not be participating in the distribution because the IDF will secure part of the operation. And this is from the same U.N. that said that they would be fine being escorted by Hamas police. I, like you, think that Israel is responsible, and it\u2019s also in not only its moral responsibility and legal responsibility but also its strategic imperative for Israel to do this if they want to achieve any of their war aims. But Israel is not alone in this. RA: And also UNRWA, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency that has a mandate to operate in Gaza, has been stymied after accusations that it had some workers who cooperated with Hamas. Sari, how does the U.N. fit in? SB: There are two kinds of obligations. One obligation is to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid by others. So that means facilitating what the U.N. and other humanitarian organizations are doing, including UNRWA. The actions that Israel has taken to try to defund UNRWA, to try to dismantle UNRWA, have been incredibly detrimental. If you want to ensure the humanitarian aid gets in, you probably shouldn\u2019t pressure foreign governments to stop funding the single largest organization delivering humanitarian aid and playing a critical role in Gaza. But beyond that, the Israeli government has an obligation to supply the aid itself. They\u2019ve done that in very limited ways, like bringing fuel to Al-Shifa Hospital. They need to do it in a much more significant way. And that doesn\u2019t contradict their obligation to let the U.N. deliver the aid. But when you bomb humanitarian convoys, when you refuse to allow them to travel or you delay them at checkpoints, when you do not try to pave the road so they can actually get through, that\u2019s not facilitating aid. And again, the Israeli government knows how to do this. This is the fifth war in Gaza that I\u2019ve documented as a human rights activist. In no previous war has the Israeli government stopped drinking water from entering Gaza. They have never cut off humanitarian aid and proudly declared that they were doing so. This is a problem of political will. I agree that U.S. pressure has been helpful. But there\u2019s something that would be even more helpful, which is to stop supplying the weapons. There\u2019s an imperative for that from the point of view of the U.S. taxpayer because all parties that are supplying Israel, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad risk complicity in those crimes because of their arms. So this includes Iran, which has been supplying Hamas and Islamic Jihad and committed war crimes against Israeli civilians. And this would include the United States and others that are funding and supplying arms to Israel. And I will say this is not a crazy idea. Canada has stopped. They\u2019ve suspended their arms transfers to the Israeli government. If the United States and others would follow suit, we\u2019d be closer to seeing the Israeli government ensure that the aid reaches people in adequate quantities. RA: Shira, how is Israel thinking through the international reaction, from the university protests to the ICC to potential U.S. withdrawal of aid, when developing its strategic perspective? SE: Israelis initially had the calculus that putting this pressure, a siege if you will, on Gaza might factor into the calculations of [Hamas leader] Yahya Sinwar, put pressure on him, and make him release hostages and surrender. This was clearly very foolish to expect from an adversary who they should have known is not prioritizing their civilian population. The policy has backfired substantially. It\u2019s not just Canada, by the way. There are six other governments banning sales of weaponry and components to Israel, and many other parliaments there are discussing it. There\u2019s the ICJ lawsuit; there\u2019s the ICC. Israel basically started this war with lots of sympathy from the world. If we want to take a metaphor from a different conflict around the world, Israel started the war as Ukraine, and seven months after, it\u2019s Russia. So, in a sense, what the humanitarian debacle, I would call it on the part of Israel, basically means is that the world does not back Israel as it has initially. From an Israeli national security perspective, Israel got all this backing, and this backing is now questionable. There are calls for Israel to go for a cease-fire in Gaza even without getting the hostages because the international community is terrified about the humanitarian catastrophe. RA: Sari, if Israel takes more steps to allow more aid into Gaza, who would be in charge? SB: I mean, right now there are a lot of people operating in Gaza. It\u2019s just that their operations are constrained. Humanitarian workers should be allowed to do their jobs. That means stop killing them. It means open up the roads for them. It means approve the requests to deliver to secure convoys coming in. It means grant visas to humanitarian aid workers. Human Rights Watch had researchers in Al-Arish on the Egyptian-Gaza border, and we interviewed humanitarian workers who were saying that the Israeli government has provided no lists of what\u2019s forbidden; if a truckload arrives with an item that\u2019s not allowed in (and it\u2019s difficult to know what that is), the entire truck gets sent back. People talk a lot about who should control Gaza in the day after. I think right now we need to look at who is already exercising control in Gaza. In northern Gaza, the Israeli government is exercising effective control. You have personnel there. You bring in the food. Armies do this all the time. It\u2019s not that hard. It just requires a will. And in southern Gaza, where there is more of an aid operation, you would just need to facilitate the entry of those goods. And in terms of plans for a Rafah invasion, one of the biggest concerns is that they\u2019re planning to evacuate people to an area that has no infrastructure\u2014not sanitation, not food, and certainly not aid delivery. So refraining from doing that would also be a good start. RA: Shira, what would it look like were Israel to begin to cede some control that it has? SE: I just don\u2019t see what Sari is proposing occurring with the IDF actually administering northern Gaza. My fear is that unless we connect those technical issues and the humanitarian issue, if we don\u2019t think about the day after and connect it to the political situation in Gaza, we\u2019re just going to see more and more of that. At the end of the day, if the hostages come back home? There\u2019s a permanent cease-fire? Clearly, Hamas is going to be the victor. And the cease-fire is going to be violated because it always has been. I don\u2019t see the international community coming in with the tens of billions of dollars required to reconstruct Gaza. So we will have some minimal recovery, and then the next operation will be back at those issues, unfortunately, as long as Hamas is the de facto government of Gaza. The jury\u2019s still out. We don\u2019t know if Hamas will stay as the de facto government of Gaza after this war, but it looks more and more likely that Israel will not be able to dismantle Hamas. As someone who lives in Tel Aviv and has legitimate security concerns from Hamas, we\u2019re going to keep seeing those problems. If there\u2019s one silver lining from this catastrophe of Oct. 7 and the war that followed, it\u2019s that maybe this is time to go back to basics and understand that we cannot look at Gaza in silo and West Bank in silo\u2014we\u2019re talking about Palestinian people. Whether Israelis like it or not, they\u2019re here to stay. And the Israelis are not going anywhere. And we sort of back off this idea of the Palestinian state. We can speak at length about the limitations of the Palestinian Authority. But at the end of the day, when we speak about Palestinian society, it\u2019s a two-party system. There\u2019s Hamas, and there\u2019s Fatah. And alternative to Hamas is trying to think of how do we bring back\u2014including with local powers inside Gaza\u2014the Palestinian Authority, stop the divide between the West Bank and Gaza, and start creating the basics of a Palestinian state that hopefully one day can disconnect from Israel. SB: I would just say that any conversation about who should rule Gaza should be a conversation that Palestinians have, including through free and fair elections. People talk about the Palestinian Authority as having international legitimacy, but it has international legitimacy because it\u2019s propped up by Israel and the United States. And on that front, a related thing we\u2019re seeing is a crackdown, within the West Bank, on political dissidents. So people belonging to other factions besides Fatah are being arrested and imprisoned in very large numbers in the West Bank. Many observers believe this is designed to quell any kind of alternative to the Palestinian Authority. So not doing that, and allowing Palestinians to exercise some agency in who should represent them, would be a good start.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Cairo\u2019s decision to seal the border has exacerbated a humanitarian disaster. It\u2019s also illegal.",
                    "post_content": "In recent months, Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip has experienced population expansion on a dramatic scale. Before the war, the Rafah area, which abuts the Egyptian border, was home to around 275,000 people. Now, an estimated 1.5 million people are crammed in there, many in tent cities visible in satellite images. In February, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that an Israeli military operation in Rafah, as Israeli officials have repeatedly said they are planning to do, \u201cwould exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences.\u201d This latest armed conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups perpetrated mass atrocities against Israel, including killings, brutal mutilations, torture, and sexual assaults. More than 200 Israelis and other nationals were abducted, ranging in age from 10 months to 86 years. More than 100 remain unaccounted for. In response, Israel unleashed a military campaign of extraordinary intensity. The civilian death toll in Gaza is intolerably high, especially the estimated 14,000 Palestinian children who have been killed. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of Hamas and in the absence of a hostage deal it is intent on continuing its military campaign. According to the United Nations, famine is imminent. The World Bank and U.N. also estimate that more than 60 percent of all homes in the territory have been damaged or destroyed as well as vital medical and civilian infrastructure. In all, some 1.7 million Palestinians have been internally displaced. So why, in a war of this intensity, are there no refugees? Or perhaps the question should be asked in a slightly different way: Where are the refugees from Gaza? The simple answer is that most Palestinians are trapped within Gaza behind fortified borders, impregnable to all but those with international passports or exceptional connections. According to the Egyptian government, nearly 4,000 people have been evacuated into the country for medical treatment along with their families. A further 67,000 foreign and dual nationals have also been able to leave, but these are not refugees, and most foreign and dual nationals will have since moved on from Egypt. By way of comparison, at the end of last year 6.5 million refugees from Syria and nearly 6 million Ukrainians were being provided protection outside their countries. In any conflict of this scale and with this magnitude of pain and suffering, one would anticipate a mass influx of refugees into surrounding countries. There have been few situations in living memory where an entire blockade has prevented people from escaping imminent threats to life and limb. It is remarkable that more than six months into this conflict so few people have had the chance to leave, even though there are daily statements from international organizations that there is no safe place in Gaza; even though UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, says it cannot provide protection or assistance; and even as the international community says humanitarian relief is not reaching those most in need. Wherever people flee from or to, states are prohibited from sending anyone to face risks of war, torture, or persecution. This universal obligation includes letting people escape, giving sanctuary for as long as the threat persists and to return safely when conditions allow. These rights originate in the teachings of the monotheistic religions. According to Islamic migration law, individuals have the right to seek and be granted asylum in any Muslim state. Judaism, whose people have long fled persecution, has a biblical principle of welcoming and protecting the stranger. Torture in the conflict is widespread. I have reviewed evidence of the extreme torture perpetrated during the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas and other Palestinian fighters, as well as reports of ongoing violations against hostages. My office has received allegations of torture and mistreatment by Israeli forces against detained Palestinians. The collective punishment of the Palestinian people is, in my legal opinion, tantamount to torture. While there is little legal ambiguity and the right to asylum is an apolitical right, there are few more politicized regions than the Middle East. Neighboring Arab countries have historically borne the greatest burden of influxes of fleeing Palestinians, and these influxes have often caused significant political instability in their own states. Israel has an abysmal track record of allowing Palestinians who have fled to reenter. So it is unsurprising that Arab leaders are now deeply sensitive to any charge of helping to facilitate the mass expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza. This would be a \u201cred line,\u201d according to King Abdullah II of Jordan. The possibility of Palestinians fleeing en masse in a repeat of the Nakba\u2014the displacement of around half the Arab population of Palestine in 1948\u2014haunts leaders in Cairo, throughout the region, and well beyond. In due course, the International Court of Justice will determine whether there has been a genocide in Gaza. The court\u2019s provisional measures recognize that all states have obligations to prevent genocide, which would include preventing the killings of members of a national group, by, for example, letting them leave the territory. Despite the complexities of the politics of this conflict, the legal reality is that states cannot pick and choose which human rights obligations to implement. It is self-evident that Israel will not open its borders to Palestinian refugees, but the Israeli state and Egypt have legal obligations to do so. Egypt\u2019s decision to seal its border with Gaza violates international humanitarian law and international refugee law. Egypt cites security concerns as a reason for not letting in Palestinian refugees, especially given the challenges of militancy in the Sinai Peninsula potentially being aggravated by the arrival of battle-hardened fighters from Gaza alongside civilians. While that threat certainly exists, the international legal framework includes safeguards to protect against this, and robust screening processes must be put in place to ensure that militants do not cross the border alongside civilians. Early in the conflict, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told CNBC that he could see \u201cno reason why Egypt, which is hosting 9 million refugees\u2014hosting them and providing them integration into our society at considerable burden on our economy\u2014should have to bear solely [the] additional influx of Gazans.\u201d That figure appears to be way off the mark, at least based on the latest UNHCR statistics. The U.N. Refugee Agency says Egypt currently hosts 575,000 registered refugees and asylum-seekers from 61 countries, while another nearly 250,000 refugees have not yet been registered. More than half of those registered are Sudanese, with Syrians forming the next largest group. The estimated number of Palestinians in Egypt is unclear as they are not included in any official figures, but may number in the hundreds of thousands. Shoukry is right, though, to say that Egypt should not have to bear responsibility for Palestinian refugees alone. Other states and international organizations must support them. UNRWA serves Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Under the 1951 Refugee Convention, responsibility transfers to UNHCR outside these areas. In other words, UNHCR is required to support Palestinian refugees who reach Egypt. The Refugee Convention stresses that international cooperation is a foundational principle and that all states must play their part. There have been reports that Egypt has been clearing land near the border preparing for refugees in the event of widescale fighting in Rafah. The international community and the U.N. have been right to call for a cease-fire and for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. With negotiations still proceeding, the humanitarian imperative to save lives must be paramount. Whenever peace is achieved, the level of destruction will take years to repair. Where and how are Palestinians from Gaza to live in the meantime? The fact remains that the right to flee and to seek asylum under law is an individual right. Palestinian families, as they consider their future, must be able make this decision for themselves. The U.N.\u2014whether it is UNRWA within the territories or UNHCR in Egypt and beyond\u2014must support Palestinian civilians. Short-term planning to help relieve pressure on Egypt and other countries receiving any refugees should include offers of medical evacuations, family reunification, and temporary protection transfers into third countries. There must be commitments of return to Gaza as soon as conditions allow. There are many precedents around the world of similar comprehensive strategies by the international community. Right now, though, civilians in Gaza have no ability to determine their fate. Starvation is becoming ever more likely, and death could come at any moment. Palestinians deserve the opportunity to choose whether they wish to flee, however painful a decision it is.",

                    "post_content": "A little shy of my teenage years, I made my first discoveries of the world outside the borders of my own country. The first of these came at Expo 67, a world fair hosted by Canada in French-speaking Montreal, where I experienced my first extended exposure to a language other than the English I had grown up with in the United States. The next trip, the following year, was much bigger in nearly every way. With my mother at the wheel, my family drove through Western Europe, where the language along with much else changed with every border crossing. In the Netherlands, I read the diary of Anne Frank. Camping in the forest of Germany, I recall falling asleep to family readings of short stories from South Africa. These spoke movingly of the inner workings of apartheid, from the racial passbook system to the brutal working conditions and long-term separations from kin suffered by poor, Black migrant workers. As much as experiences like these opened my young eyes and mind to the world, it was something staring out at me from billboard ads for weekly magazines and from newspaper front pages displayed at Europe\u2019s ubiquitous tobacco kiosks that haunted me. Day after day during that summer of 1968, continental media splashed visuals of the immense suffering stalking people in a distant part of the planet on their covers. The news in question was from Nigeria, a country then in the midst of a murderous civil war. The big display photographs were not of the violence, though, or at least not of violence as we usually think of it. Instead, as many as 3,000 people a day, most of them children, were being cut down by starvation. The Biafran War, as this conflict was called, from the adopted name of a province in southeastern Nigeria whose bid at secession failed, seized the attention of much of the world that summer. Western media put a vivid face on the suffering, the haunting visages of children reduced to stick figures with rust-colored hair, sharply protruding ribs, and oddly ballooning bellies. Suddenly everyone knew the term for this medical condition: kwashiorkor. This was the vividly grotesque result of Biafrans trying to survive with hardly any protein. For the lucky, emergency aid supplies provided paltry amounts of rice, and in their desperation, parents tried to make do by cooking up shoots of grass and weeds to serve to their starving children. It was only years later that I understood that starvation was no side effect of this war. It was baked into the very politics of the clash between two ruthless sides. What is more, the loss of much of southeastern Nigeria\u2019s population to famine that summer also reflected the politics of the various outside players\u2014Western countries, for the most part\u2014that we often reduce to a bland amalgamation, the \u201cinternational community.\u201d As morally repugnant as its position was, some in the Nigerian government nonetheless had the virtue of candor in explaining their attitude toward the death through deprivation that played out among Biafrans that horrible summer. \u201cAll is fair in war, and starvation is one of the weapons of war. I don\u2019t see why we should feed our enemies fat, only to fight us harder,\u201d said Obafemi Awolowo, then vice chairman of Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council. Awolowo\u2019s statement was wholly unfounded. Rules of war dating at least to the Geneva Convention of 1949 severely restricted, and later prohibited, the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of war. To morally complicate things further, the military leader of Biafra, Odumegwu Ojukwu, rejected the opening of a land corridor to carry international relief supplies into his breakaway region. The commonly understood reason for this was that his armies stood little chance of prevailing, and international attention to the starvation might create pressure for a settlement that he could never win on the battlefield. The outside world\u2019s role in the Nigerian conflict in 1968 was just as murky and abhorrent. The essence of this was captured in a headline in the Los Angeles Times, which read: \u201cGuns for Nigeria; Food for Biafra.\u201d This referred to Britain\u2019s unstinting armament of Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country and its former colony, where London retained many important economic interests, especially in petroleum production. Other European countries such as France (eager to strengthen its influence in Africa by helping to break up its largest English-speaking country) and Portugal (still clinging to colonial rule while Nigeria supported anti-colonial movements) aided Biafra\u2019s breakaway. While Britain bolstered Nigeria\u2019s federal government and military, it salved its own conscience by supplying a trickle of airlifted food to Biafra. An opinion column in the New York Times by Anthony Lewis that July captured some of the flavor of all this. \u201cEven in a world hardened to human inhumanity, what is happening in the Nigerian rebellion must seem unbearably pointless and cruel. It is just one more testament to the ferocity of tribal or racial feelings\u2013\u2013here African but in many other instances European\u2013\u2013that mean nothing to outsiders.\u201d Memories of the Biafra crisis, long forgotten by most people outside of West Africa, have occupied my thoughts for most of the last two weeks or so. That is because of the human and humanitarian catastrophe that has been visited upon Gaza. It seems like just yesterday that the prospect of famine among this Palestinian enclave\u2019s roughly 2.1 million people had finally risen to the point of global alarm. I say \u201cfinally\u201d because there have been warnings of catastrophic famine at least since late last year, and the international media has done little to explain how Palestinians in Gaza have managed to feed themselves, given that Israel has severely restricted the delivery by truck of relief supplies from the early stages of its assault on the territory. Even more striking is how few images the world has of the travails of the Palestinians who are cordoned off inside this war zone. For a crisis of these dimensions, the world\u2019s press should be saturated with images of daily life and suffering in Gaza. Where, moreover, are the photos of starving children, the images showing the effects of kwashiorkor or other forms of dietary restriction? The world recoiled in momentary shock earlier this month when Israel\u2019s military attacked a food convoy, killing seven workers from World Central Kitchen, a fraction of the extraordinary 200-plus aid workers killed in this war so far. But Israel has been remarkably successful in limiting independent press access to Gaza of the sort that brought the haunting images of Biafra to the attention of the world more than 55 years ago, even as 24-hour cable news channels and the constantly updated, photograph-heavy web pages of major publications have become standard. What is most remarkable to me, though, is how quickly the Gaza famine emergency story seems to have been displaced. This was not because of any breakthrough in food delivery, as far as I can tell. It seems to have been overshadowed, rather, by attention to Iran\u2019s drone-and-missile reprisal against Israel for bombing Tehran\u2019s diplomatic outpost in Damascus. If I am correct, that amounts to a dismal statement about the Western press\u2019s interest in the life of the residents of Gaza, people who are paying a price for this conflict every bit as tragic as that of the people of Biafra who were so cynically reduced to pawns by both sides decades ago. Assigning motives in war can be tricky, but it does not seem outlandish to imagine that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu timed its strike against the Iranian generals in Damascus precisely to help shift the world\u2019s attention away from the catastrophe in Gaza. There have been strong signs recently that Israel had been losing public support in the United States over its extremely violent campaign in Gaza, with a death toll now estimated at more than 33,000, most of whom are civilians. Commentators of different stripes have also long speculated that Netanyahu has sought to prolong the crisis in Gaza because to end it would bring calls for new elections in Israel, an investigation of Israel\u2019s unpreparedness for Hamas\u2019s murderous attack on Oct. 7, and the pursuit of pending legal cases involving Netanyahu himself. Equally skeptical explanations have been offered for the timing of the provocative strike in Damascus. Netanyahu, who, according to this line of interpretation, has long sought to enlist the United States in an open conflict with Iran, gave Washington virtually no forewarning of its attack on Iran\u2019s consulate, hoping that any counterattack by Tehran would force the United States to help it confront Israel\u2019s hostile neighbor. There are other columns for other days to be written about the complexities of the antagonistic triangle linking Israel, Iran, and the United States. If people are starving in Gaza, though, this is a story for right now, day after day, and the world\u2019s media outlets have no excuse for averting their gaze.",

                    "post_content": "The world has failed to halt a downward spiral in humanitarian conditions for civilians in the Gaza Strip since the Israel-Hamas war began last October. The airdropping of humanitarian aid and the U.S. plan to construct a temporary port off the coast of northern Gaza to deliver assistance, both in coordination with Israel, will not adequately relieve the crisis or eliminate its root cause. In addition to being financially unfeasible, neither approach can be sustained amid continued armed conflict and Israel\u2019s blocking of aid entering the strip via land borders. The only feasible and sustainable way to relieve the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is through an emergency mechanism that removes Israel\u2019s total control over the security inspection and entry of aid via land borders into the besieged territory. This proposed plan, limited to the duration of the war and the resulting humanitarian crisis, should include an international security task force with the limited mandate of overseeing and implementing an independent inspection and transport process for aid through Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula. This emergency mechanism is not far-fetched and could be immediately applied if world powers were willing to utilize all means necessary to rescue Palestinians in Gaza from famine, a devastated health system, and harrowing levels of deprivation. Such an intervention would boost efforts to stop the mounting threat of a regional conflict as well as bring progress toward negotiations to reach a cease-fire. Now is the time to do so. In the Sinai Peninsula, just across the border from Gaza, tens of thousands of tons of humanitarian aid are waiting for Israel\u2019s permission to enter the strip. Images show hundreds of flatbed trucks loaded with aid and blocked by Israel\u2019s security inspection system at the Kerem Shalom border crossing, including some parked for weeks. In wartime, it is imperative that aid shipments undergo strict security checks, but such a system must not be manipulated by any warring parties for military gain\u2014in this case, either Israel or Hamas. Instead, a joint task force, comprising security personnel from different governments and an international security body, could oversee the system. Egypt, Qatar, the United States, and France, in partnership with the United Nations, are the top parties\u2014but not the only ones\u2014capable of operating this limited-mandate force. All have consistently engaged both Hamas and Israel, along with local authorities and humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza, on hostages, aid and rescue, policies to protect civilians, and negotiations toward a cease-fire. Egypt is a fitting and capable host: It not only maintains the sole land border and entry point into Gaza that is not under Israeli military control, the Rafah border crossing, but it also has become the destination of most humanitarian aid dispatched for Gaza. Since the beginning of the war, shipments have continuously landed in El-Arish Airport in North Sinai, some 31 miles from the Rafah crossing\u2014which is just south of the town of Rafah in Gaza, where an estimated 1.5 million people are sheltered. In the last decade, the Egyptian military and security forces have turned this part of North Sinai into the country\u2019s most militarized zone. It is so secure that it has received heads of government, top U.N. officials, members of parliament, and other officials since the war in Gaza began. At El-Arish, French and Italian navy hospital ships have docked for weeks to provide medical aid to Palestinians, while other vessels have unloaded aid shipments. Egypt could immediately designate a site to host a security inspection effort and the joint task force needed to implement it. In fact, Cairo has already said it is building a logistics hub to host aid efforts near the Rafah crossing terminal. Since the war began, senior U.S. officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and CIA Director Bill Burns have conducted multiple visits and engaged in talks with regional governments involved with efforts to contain the conflict. After the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden appointed David Satterfield as special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues. Satterfield is no stranger to the region\u2019s volatile security; he served as director-general of the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai Peninsula from 2009 to 2017. Qatar and France are as active as Egypt and the United States in all levels of engagement with the warring parties. Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha, hosts the Hamas leadership outside of Gaza. Qatari efforts have led to the release of Israeli civilians held hostage by Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack. Qatar and France also secured a deal to allow delivery of lifesaving medicines to Gaza\u2019s hospitals as well as to Hamas-held hostages. Qatar also constructed and operates a field hospital inside the strip and has dispatched aid to North Sinai since the start of the war. Finally, the United Nations has powerful reach and ability, especially through on-the-ground humanitarian operations in Gaza. Its various bodies, including the Secretariat, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees, and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, are in constant communication and coordination with all parties involved. Despite the level of destruction in Gaza, they operate a broad network of employees and facilities dedicated to humanitarian aid. With a force as small as 100 well-equipped security personnel and a site secured and serviced by Egypt\u2019s military and local authorities at the Sinai-Gaza border, the joint security task force could theoretically inspect up to 50 trucks per hour, delivering the required minimum of 500 trucks per day within 10 hours. Cargo planes could not airdrop a fraction of that aid over Gaza every day for an extended period. And according to the United States, its port plan will take around two months, as many as 1,000 troops, and millions of dollars to provide just 2 million meals per day. The emergency mechanism\u2019s mandate would stop at the delivery of aid across Egypt\u2019s Rafah terminal into Gaza. It would not encroach on the jurisdiction of local authorities and organizations or replace them. Within this strictly limited mandate, the aid mechanism and its task force wouldn\u2019t pose a threat to any warring parties or provide political or military gain. It would operate impartially for the protection and rescue of civilians, most of whom are women and children. An alternative mechanism to deliver humanitarian aid would not only save civilian lives, but it would also create a path toward a lasting solution that averts further crisis. Delivering the minimum required aid to Gaza could satisfy the basic needs of the 1.5 million people sheltering in Rafah within days. It would help reinforce Gaza\u2019s devastated health care system and mitigate the risk of infectious diseases and chronic illnesses caused by malnutrition and medical shortages. With an emergency mechanism in place that guarantees delivery without manipulation, donor countries and organizations would increase their efforts to send humanitarian aid to Gaza to satisfy the unprecedented level of need. Such guarantees could also contain panic across Gaza, creating a safer environment for organizations to transport and distribute aid throughout the strip. A continued flow of aid would gradually end the overwhelming of convoys by desperate civilians and undercut war profiteers and organized gangs seeking to commandeer shipments. By hosting such an effort, Egypt would avoid its looming nightmare: a sudden influx of refugees crossing its borders in pursuit of safety and sustenance that would possibly deal a blow to the Camp David Accords, which maintains peace between Egypt and Israel. On a domestic level, the joint aid effort would address popular anger with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for failing to open the Rafah border crossing and unilaterally deliver aid to Gaza\u2014with practical measures rather than ineffective statements and oppression of Egypt\u2019s political opposition. An alternative aid mechanism would also have far-reaching effects on growing regional conflict in the Middle East. While international powers and mediators are scrambling to contain hostilities between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel and the Houthi threat in the Red Sea, a practical approach to enforce a solution to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza could advance potential negotiations. Both Hezbollah and the Houthis have repeatedly pointed to the siege on Gaza\u2019s people in official statements; although both have other calculations behind their attacks against Israel and its interests, containing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza would serve as a step toward reaching a settlement on both fronts. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government will most certainly oppose any such efforts. But it is in the immediate power of the international community, and especially the Biden administration, to confront Israel and enforce solutions that will save lives. In this case, any Israeli opposition to the mechanism, whether by attempting to block its inception or by targeting aid after it enters Gaza, would be directed at a consortium of international and regional powers. It would also contravene the provisional measures laid out by the International Court of Justice: that Israel \u201ctake immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance to address the adverse conditions of life faced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\u201d As Israel\u2019s top provider of arms and aid, and in light of the potential threat that Biden\u2019s policies toward the war in Gaza pose to his electoral prospects in November, it is in the administration\u2019s interest to use its leverage to compel Israel not to block such an extraordinary measure. Failing to endorse and partner in such an effort would deepen the growing gap between the United States and the Middle East, leaving a vacuum that will inevitably be filled by other world powers. Six months into the Israel-Hamas war, it would be naive to assume that any progress could be accomplished without an immediate and collaborative intervention by regional and international powers to remedy the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Only then will hindered talks toward a cease-fire agreement and a settlement of the war stand a chance.",

                    "post_excerpt": "In the Middle East, nothing is ever simple\u2014including the provision of humanitarian aid.",
                    "post_content": "Gaza faces an increasingly dire humanitarian situation: Some 80 percent of the population has been displaced; food, medicine, and shelter are all in short supply; the United Nations estimates that some 576,000 people are on the brink of famine; and the World Food Program has concluded that some 70 percent of northern Gazans face \u201ccatastrophic hunger.\u201d To get aid into the enclave, the United States and other countries are now turning to increasingly creative measures, including airdrops and floating piers off the Gazan coast. As the Washington Post recently opined, the United States seeks \u201ca logistically complicated workaround to \u2026 a fundamentally simple problem: Getting aid into Gaza by land.\u201d But as with everything in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the problem is rarely as straightforward as it might seem. In this case, the humanitarian disaster in Gaza is not one problem, but at least two. There is the throughput problem\u2014getting aid into Gaza\u2014and then there is the distribution problem, which involves getting aid to those who need it most. Both problems come with their own unique challenges, but the latter\u2014which has attracted far less attention\u2014will be more difficult to solve. Before the war, roughly 500 trucks passed into Gaza every day from Israel and Egypt. Now, according to United Nations data, that number stands at roughly 150. In February\u2014during the height of the fighting in Khan Younis, which the Israeli military described as a Hamas stronghold\u2014the number of truckloads slowed to a trickle; on some days, fewer than 10 trucks made it into the enclave. From these basic facts, two dueling narratives have emerged. Humanitarian aid groups, as well as various governments around the world, allege that this slowdown of trucks in Gaza is due to arbitrary and time-consuming inspections by the Israeli military. In addition to the Kerem Shalom crossing on Israel\u2019s border with southern Gaza, some aid also flows across the Egypt-Gaza border at Rafah\u2014but this is insufficient to supply Gaza\u2019s needs. If Israel was only to relax its inspections, open the Erez border crossing to northern Gaza, and allow aid to flow through Israel\u2019s nearby deep-water port of Ashdod, the humanitarian problem would be solved, these critics argue. Israeli government officials counter that the inspection regime is necessary, given Hamas\u2019s documented penchant to hide military supplies inside humanitarian aid. The Israelis also note that not all of those 500 daily prewar truckloads were filled with humanitarian supplies. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine (UNRWA), which oversaw much aid distribution, only averaged 100 truckloads a day before the conflict began. By some measures, humanitarian aid into Gaza has actually increased from its prewar levels. Much of the humanitarian catastrophe currently unfolding in Gaza, the Israeli government argues, is due to Hamas diverting the food and other supplies being trucked in\u2014instead of distributing these goods to the civilian population. On closer inspection, however, key aspects of the Israeli narrative begin to fall apart. Even if aid convoys are up from prewar levels, demand has shot up much more. With more than 32,000 Gazans killed and another 71,000 wounded, the need for medical supplies alone has increased dramatically compared to peacetime. Fighting has also destroyed warehouses and stores\u2014and with them, many of the existing food stockpiles. At least three-quarters of the housing stock in Gaza also has been damaged or destroyed, exponentially expanding the need for temporary housing. By even the most cursory analysis, the humanitarian needs today in Gaza vastly exceed those prior to the conflict. By contrast, Israel\u2019s reticence to move aid into Gaza seems to be driven less by strategic reasons than it is by political ones. Just days before the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel reopened the Erez crossing after it had been closed for two weeks due to violent protests instigated by Hamas. But on Oct. 7, Hamas attacked the newly reopened crossing, killing 10 Israeli soldiers there. To an Israeli public still reeling from Hamas\u2019s atrocities, reviving this failed olive branch would carry a serious political cost for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s hard right government. Admittedly, there are other, more tangible constraints on the Israeli side for humanitarian relief. As has been widely reported, Israel has been consistently surprised by Hamas\u2019s military capabilities. Simply put, decades of Israeli border restrictions did not prevent Hamas from assembling thousands of rockets and building hundreds of miles of tunnels. While this rationale does not absolve Israel of some of its seemingly arbitrary restrictions on aid convoys over the past several months, it does mean that the Israeli inspection regimen on everything going into Gaza\u2014humanitarian, commercial, or other deliveries\u2014will be tighter than before by strategic necessity, not least because the old rules failed. Further complicating matters, Gaza is a small place with a limited number of border crossings. At least half its roads have been damaged after nearly six months of war, according to the World Bank. Those that remain also need to support military use. Militaries of any size\u2014the Israel Defense Forces included\u2014consume vast supplies of food and petroleum and spare parts in the field in order to sustain combat operations. So the Israeli military must move its personnel and materiel on some of the same roads that humanitarian aid convoys would use. Given that Hamas ambushes Israeli convoys, the last thing that any military would want is for its vehicles to be snarled in a traffic jam. Most of these bandwidth constraints are fixable. New routes for aid are already being developed. Israel has also demonstrated that it can build new roads in Gaza despite the war, if it wants to. And some of the outside-the-box solutions\u2014from floating piers to air drops\u2014can augment the land routes into Gaza as well. But even if the Israeli narrative on getting aid into Gaza is not entirely convincing, that does not mean that aid does not also have a distribution problem. Israel alleges that Hamas operatives have attacked aid convoys and stolen food from them. But even bracketing the degree of direct Hamas involvement, Gazan civilians have rushed aid convoys, ransacked warehouses, and even stormed private houses to get to the airdropped packages. None of this should be surprising. After all, people will go to great lengths to avoid starvation. The lack of security impedes humanitarian aid in other ways as well. The sheer physics of parachuting aid out of moving airplanes means that these packages stand a high chance of being diverted, especially if the drop zones are not secured on ground. Distributing aid also requires warehouses to store these supplies, but the UNRWA reports that more than 150 of its facilities have been damaged or destroyed in the fighting. Given that Israel alleges that many of these warehouses were also used by Hamas for weapons storage, Israel likely will not allow these facilities to be rebuilt or promise not target them again, absent some sort of credible guarantees that Hamas will not exploit them. And as the United States\u2019 pause on UNRWA funding demonstrates, donor countries may also be reluctant to provide aid in the first place if those supplies risk being diverted to Hamas or other militants. Without restoring law and order in Gaza, then, getting aid to the most vulnerable will remain a challenge, even if Israel and the international community increase the amount of aid entering the enclave. Aid effectiveness will thus prove a far thornier issue to solve. Ideally, the Palestinians themselves should provide the security to enable aid distribution. But right now, it is not at all clear just who those Palestinians would be. Before the war, Hamas largely controlled Gaza\u2019s local authorities. Giving those same individuals power over a vital resource such as food will, by default, also help reestablish Hamas\u2019s hold over the enclave. Israel has so far eschewed the idea that the Palestinian Authority could control Gaza, citing the West Bank government\u2019s payments to Palestinians whose relatives have been imprisoned for terrorism. But even if Israel dropped its objections, it is not clear if the Palestinian Authority\u2019s security forces are up for such a mission. Israel has also floated the idea of turning to non-Hamas-aligned Gazans to run Gaza. But given Hamas\u2019s success in crushing all political opposition and independent civil society since the 2007 fighting between Hamas and Fatah over the control of Gaza, this would very likely empower organized crime syndicates\u2014hardly the people you want caring for the vulnerable. Alternatively, Israel could turn to an external actor to protect aid distribution. Israel has talked about hiring private security contractors to protect aid shipments. But as we saw in Iraq and elsewhere, the use of contractors can be a risky, resource intensive, and not always successful proposition\u2014not to mention the new controversies such a step would surely generate. More likely, a state would need to provide a peacekeeping force. The Biden administration has explicitly ruled out U.S. \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in Gaza, and so far, no other country has stepped up. That\u2019s because inserting troops into an ongoing war is guaranteed to be a losing proposition: Israel would likely blame this third party for any residual Hamas terrorism, while Palestinians and their supporters around the world would likely accuse the country of collaborating with Israel. And all the while, the peacekeepers would be caught in the crossfire, and any hiccup in the flow of aid would now become the peacekeeping forces\u2019 fault. Finally, the Wall Street Journal reported on March 21 that some Israeli security officials have proposed an all-of-the above strategy. The plan foresees a mixture of non-Hamas Gazan leaders, as well current and former Palestinian Authority security officials, taking over aid distribution\u2014and ultimately, governance in Gaza\u2014with the support of Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and other Arab governments. But so far, the plan has gotten a cold reception. Hamas obviously opposes being cut out of governing Gaza, but even some of the Palestinian leaders in question have stated that they do not want the job. The Netanyahu government is only lukewarm to the idea because it includes the Palestinian Authority. All that is left is the Israelis themselves. Unlike the local Palestinian option, the Israel Defense Forces certainly have the capability to provide the security necessary for humanitarian actors to do their work. Unlike external security guarantors, the Israeli military is already in Gaza, and by default, it already owns the humanitarian problem, whether it wants to or not. But if the Israeli military takes over providing security for aid distribution, that means that it will end up patrolling Gazan streets for at least the next few months\u2014and more likely for the next few years or however long it takes until a Palestinian force is ready to assume the same role. All of which leads to an outcome that nobody wants: the reoccupation of Gaza. And this, in turn, leads to another basic truth: While there are few straightforward problems in the Middle East, there are even fewer straightforward solutions. In this case, if the international community wants to solve the humanitarian problem in Gaza, it will need to go well beyond thinking of the issue strictly in terms of trucks, roads, and floating piers. It will instead need to choose between a series of bad options: offering up some sort of external peacekeeping force, accepting a temporary Israeli reoccupation, or doing nothing at all and letting aid fall into the hands of a variety of nefarious actors. None of these are particularly appealing outcomes. But in the Middle East, nothing is ever simple.",

                    "post_content": "Even if Israel and Hamas agree to a cease-fire and it holds, normalcy will not return to Gaza anytime soon. For the Palestinians living there, the biggest long-term danger they face may not be Hamas or Israel\u2014it could be a lack of government altogether. A postwar Gaza may join the ranks of Libya, Somalia, Yemen, and other states that suffer near-constant low-level strife, endemic crime, and humanitarian crisis after humanitarian crisis. Such states tend to produce waves of desperate refugees and can fuel further violence. In Gaza\u2019s modern history, different regimes have ruled the strip, rarely doing so for the benefit of its residents. After the British colonial presence ended in 1948 and a war commenced over Israel\u2019s independence, Egyptian troops advanced into Gaza as part of their attack on Israel, and they kept control of the region in the 1949 armistice agreement between Egypt and Israel. In the years after, Egypt sought to both suppress and exploit Palestinian activism and political Islam. Palestinian cross-border raids were an instrument against Israel, but they could create an escalatory spiral. In the 1950s, repeated cross-border raids contributed to Israel\u2019s decision to go to war against Egypt in 1956. When Israel took power after conquering Gaza in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, it also feared Palestinian activism, though it was more permissive than Egypt in allowing political Islam to develop. Under Israeli rule, Gaza\u2019s economy improved, but the enclave remained poorly governed, with Israel less concerned about the well-being of Palestinians and more worried about their support for Palestinian nationalism. The Palestinian National Authority, a forerunner of the Palestinian Authority (PA), took over the governance of Gaza and portions of the West Bank as part of the Oslo Accords, assuming control in 1994 under Yasser Arafat\u2019s leadership. Although finally under Palestinian rule, the Palestinian leaders were primarily from the diaspora, not Gaza, and the PA focused more on the West Bank. Again, Gaza remained neglected. Israel reoccupied Gaza during the Second Intifada, which began in 2000, and it withdrew in 2005. Although Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas weakened its terrorist capabilities, Hamas won a parliamentary election in 2006 and then seized power in Gaza in 2007. Finally, a Gaza-based organization was running Gaza. In some ways, life for Palestinians in the enclave improved\u2014despite Hamas\u2019s repressive ideology. It cracked down on crime, crushed local warlords, provided health and educational services, and was less corrupt than the PA. At the same time, Israel and much of the international community rejected Hamas\u2019s legitimacy. The group continued waging sporadic attacks on Israel, and Israeli governments placed severe limits on Gaza\u2019s economic development and regularly engaged in destructive military campaigns in the enclave. Israel tried to balance this with limited economic concessions to Gaza, such as issuing more worker permits and offering greater fishing rights, and allowing millions of dollars in aid from Qatar to go to Gaza if Hamas stopped military attacks\u2014a policy that Israel thought was working until the attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, dispelled this illusion. Whatever limited gains Palestinians in Gaza may have made under Hamas rule have been shattered by Israel\u2019s military response to the attacks committed by Hamas on Oct. 7. The Israeli campaign has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians and displaced 1.9 million people\u201485 percent of the enclave\u2019s population. More than half of Gaza\u2019s buildings had been damaged or fully destroyed by late January. The United Nations estimates that Gaza will need decades to recover at the cost of tens of billions of dollars\u2014money that may never be provided. And U.N. officials warn that famine and disease will soon sweep the strip. Some aid does get in, but much of it does not go to the neediest. Hamas has blended in with the population, and much of the day-to-day governance of Gaza, including policing, is gone as Israel continues to target what it considers to be Hamas\u2019s infrastructure in Gaza. Criminal gangs now regularly rob unprotected aid convoys, selling what they steal to desperate Gazans. Although a cease-fire would reduce some of the suffering, it does not resolve the most important political question: Who will rule Gaza? Israel understandably does not want the Hamas regime that murdered around 1,200 of its citizens to return to power and vows to destroy Hamas. Yet all the other contenders for power are weak, including the PA. Any non-Hamas government has to worry about two sets of armed actors. Israel is likely to continue at least limited operations against the remnants of Hamas, assassinating its leaders and otherwise trying to prevent the group from reconsolidating. Hamas, for its part, might attack any interim government in order to ensure its political preeminence, and this is especially true if that government cooperates with Israel on security. As for Gaza\u2019s economy, even massive aid would not restore conditions that existed before Oct. 7\u2014tenuous as they were. Although initial reports claiming that Palestinians from Gaza who worked in Israel had aided the Oct. 7 terrorists appear to be wrong, suspicion toward Palestinians among Israelis will remain high. Israel has accused the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)\u2014which for decades has provided education, health care, food, and other services in Gaza\u2014of being penetrated by Hamas. More broadly, the Oct. 7 attacks discredited Israel\u2019s carrot-and-stick approach of offering limited economic concessions backed up by the threat of force to encourage moderation from Hamas. The future will see few carrots and far more sticks. Foreign aid, while necessary for daily survival in Gaza, also comes with its own long-term risks for any government in the enclave. Aid from outsiders could have a corrupting effect, making any government less accountable to its own people; ordinary Palestinians in Gaza would have no way to stop officials from siphoning off aid and abusing their power. This mix of chaos, privation, and conflict poses long-term risks not just for Palestinians, but also for Israel and the rest of the regional states. Many of Gaza\u2019s people will try to leave if they can, with next-door neightbor Egypt being the most likely destination, should Cairo allow it. These conditions are also natural feeders for violent groups, which can easily recruit young men who need a paycheck and are bitter toward Israel and the international community for their role in Gaza\u2019s desperate condition. The Israel-Hamas war\u2019s end would only mark the end of a chapter in the book of Palestinian suffering: The next chapter may be about the chaotic postwar period. Too often, U.S. and international policy in the region is focused on establishing a cease-fire or beginning negotiations, and not enough on lessening the suffering of ordinary people. To reduce the risk of long-term state failure, the United States, European Union members, and others hoping for a solution to the conflict should focus on who will rule Gaza and how that entity\u2019s rule will be enforced in the long term.",

                    "post_content": "The images of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel\u2014during which around 1,200 men, women and children were killed\u2014instantly became the centerpiece of an intense information warfare campaign. For the first time since the Second Intifada, global public opinion was exposed to mass Israeli civilian casualties as images of atrocities committed by Hamas and other armed groups as well as Gazan civilians circulated widely on social media. Israel and pro-Israeli advocacy groups emphasized the horror of the massacre by distributing the images, mostly to western audiences , through paid advertisement videos on YouTube and X (formerly known as Twitter), in family-oriented videogames, and in screenings of a 45-minute supercut of the footage for select audiences, including in Washington, D.C. and Hollywood. The goal was not solely to raise awareness of the shocking events of Oct. 7, however. Instead, with the ads, the government claimed a right to defend its people and implied that the attacks extended a carte blanche for retaliation. The use of social media as a tool of information warfare is not new in Israel. Since Israel\u2019s Operation Cast Lead, which killed more than 1,000 Gazans in December 2008 and January 2009, a battle of narratives on social media has become an essential part of the fractious discourse between Israelis and Palestinians. Palestinians and their supporters started using social media to disseminate evidence\u2014texts, photographs, and videos\u2014of civilian deaths and widespread destruction in Gaza to mobilize global public opinion against Israel. And the Israeli government, Israelis, and their supporters started employing social media to counter the Palestinians and their supporters in the digital space. Israel subsequently started to place greater emphasis on dominating the flow of information during conflict to ensure superiority on the battlefield and to build support for its war efforts. With social media conscripting the broader public into war efforts, over the next decade the Israeli state and its supporters sought to shape the global narrative around Israel\u2019s military operations, particularly during escalations with militants in Gaza. Yet for some time the Israeli efforts weren\u2019t quite as successful at influencing global public opinion as the organic and dynamic, albeit less organized, pro-Palestinian campaigns. Roughly a decade ago, Israel\u2019s Ministry of Strategic Affairs began to oversee a network of influencers and pro-Israeli organizations that advanced the Israeli state\u2019s message against the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign and other critics of the occupation, through deceptive, coordinated campaigns designed to appear grassroots-driven and spontaneous. During Israel\u2019s 2021 war with Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces ran a covert social media campaign praising its bombing of Gaza to improve perception of its performance among the Israeli public. And Israel increased its digital diplomacy outreach to major Western technology companies. A Meta internal audit found that in 2021 the company censored Arabic content at a higher rate than Hebrew content, apparently in response to Israeli government requests. Social media\u2019s fragmentation and deterioration transformed the digital battlefield after Elon Musk purchased what was then Twitter in October 2022 and Meta laid off thousands of workers and divested from moderation and fact-checking in 2023. Even before these changes, algorithms used by social media platforms favored content that triggered strong emotions, particularly anger. Musk has, in practice, abandoned X\u2019s stated ambition to be a global public sphere and removed checks that reined in outrage and misinformation. The platforms now function less as marketplaces of ideas and more as spaces to lock down one\u2019s own base and discredit those one believes are hostile to it. Israeli and pro-Israeli actors have adeptly navigated these changes, leveraging the altered dynamics of social media to their advantage. Hamas\u2019s graphic and live-streamed massacre on Oct. 7 last year, followed by Israel\u2019s extensive destruction of Gaza, provided a huge volume of images that served as ready-made content for this new digital environment. Israel has followed a four-pronged strategy in its information warfare: emphasize the horrors of the Oct. 7 massacre; discredit pro-Palestinian voices and justify the bombing of Gaza; limit the flow of information about the conflict coming out of Gaza; and rally the Israeli public by advertising its military prowess and destruction of Gaza. Israel\u2019s investments over the past decade began to pay off as the details of the Oct. 7 massacre spilled over into the policy discourse. Several artificial intelligence (AI) companies in Israel and the United States that were supporting Israeli information warfare before the war began were ready to roll into action. Within days of the Hamas attack, Akooda, an Israeli technology company, created Words of Iron, an AI-powered application users could use to amplify social media posts and narratives supporting Israel and report posts critical of Israel\u2014all while seeming grassroots and authentic. U.S. President Joe Biden repeated at least twice misleading claims that first circulated on social media, including by top Israeli officials. On Oct. 10, Biden claimed to have seen pictures proving that Hamas had beheaded 40 children in the Oct. 7 attack\u2014a charge that was disproved. That same night, the White House clarified that Biden had not seen the pictures. Then, on Oct. 28, Biden said that he had \u201cno confidence\u201d in casualty figures reported by the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. The figures have turned out to be accurate. The Oct. 7 massacre rapidly became the cornerstone of an Israeli social media campaign. The narratives circulating online drew parallels between Hamas and the Islamic State, blurred the line between civilians and combatants, claimed that Palestinians reject coexistence, and framed Israel\u2019s campaign as a humanitarian fight to free Palestinians from Hamas. Emphasizing the violence of Hamas\u2019 attacks helped Israel tell a one-dimensional story of a multi-dimensional conflict\u2014one that left out its decades of occupation, blockade of Gaza, and systematic violence against the Palestinians. Five months into the war, Israel has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, injured more than 70,000, and displaced around 1.9 million from their homes. The Israeli airstrikes have created a level of urban destruction more severe than in Aleppo in Syria or Mariupol in Ukraine, destroying or damaging close to one-third of buildings in Gaza. As the extraordinary scale of civilian killings and destruction of homes in Gaza became visible on social media and protesters filled the streets in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States, Israel\u2019s information warfare strategy focused on deflecting attention from it. To this end, Israel has capitalized on polarization in Europe and the United States by pushing a simple narrative: Criticizing the war is\u00a0anti-Semitic and protesting the mass killing\u00a0of Palestinians is to do the\u00a0bidding of Hamas. Israel ran advertisement campaigns estimated to cost up to $7.1 million in October to accuse Palestinian supporters of being complicit in Hamas\u2019 crimes. The government efforts were supported by pro-Israeli groups, which in the United States spent more than $2 million in advertisements on social media, spending roughly 100 times more than Palestinian advocacy groups. Israel\u2019s bid was partly helped by Palestinian supporters\u2019 own efforts to manipulate the information environment. Pro-Palestinian groups increasingly resorted to using misinformation themselves. Extremist voices and so-called truthers used anger at the apparent lack of empathy among Western media and politicians for the suffering of Gazans to gain space. Groups from the far-right and the far-left\u2014including Holocaust deniers\u2014started spreading conspiracy theories framing the Oct. 7 attack as a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation carried out by the Israeli army. Many pro-Palestinian voices amplified these claims and other misleading content. Since Oct. 7, members of Israel\u2019s cabinet and parliament have used increasingly dehumanizing language about Palestinians and Gaza aimed at blurring the line between Hamas combatants and Gaza\u2019s civilian population\u2014some of which was cited in South Africa\u2019s filing against Israel at the International Court of Justice. This has been reflected on social media, where calls for Gaza to be \u201cflattened,\u201d \u201cerased\u201d or \u201cdestroyed\u201d were put out about 18,000 times in Hebrew posts on X in the first month of the war, compared to an average of 16 monthly mentions before the war. While the Israeli government insisted that the use of such language wasn\u2019t official policy, Israel seems to have encouraged it as part of its social media strategy. In October, a psychological warfare unit of the Israel Defense Forces reportedly started a covert Telegram channel targeting the Israeli public, which posted thousands of images of soldiers killing Hamas militants and the destruction of Gaza. As the war progressed, an increasing number of Israeli soldiers posted videos from Gaza, gleefully boasting about killing Palestinians, dancing, or desecrating Palestinian graveyards. Meanwhile, Israel continued running social media campaigns seeking to deflect criticism for the staggering death toll it has inflicted on Gaza\u2019s population. The official Israel account on X shared a video viewed nearly 10 million times of an alleged armed Hamas militant in the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza. The video actually showed a man holding a baton or crutch. Journalists and humanitarian workers have been falsely accused of being complicit in crimes committed by Hamas. The Israeli advocacy group Honest Reporting accused Palestinian photographers working for major international news outlets of being embedded with Hamas militants during the Oct. 7 attack and even carrying weapons. Even though Honest Reporting later backtracked on the claims, Israel\u2019s X account has not removed its posts promoting those discredited claims nor added a reference to Honest Reporting\u2019s clarifications. The Israeli government understands that confused audiences gravitate toward selective facts that reinforce their existing notions of the conflict. Israel has controlled the flow of information by limiting international media access to Gaza, targeting communication infrastructure in Gaza, causing electricity blackouts, depleting users and internet providers of fuel needed to charge phones and servers, and imposing long internet blackouts. While it can\u2019t completely take Palestinians offline, the Israeli government has limited the amount of reliable information coming from the ground. At the same time, 70 Palestinian journalists were killed in the first two months of the war by Israeli airstrikes\u2014a number that has since risen to 90. Israel also vigorously lobbied social media platforms to take down content from Palestinians and their supporters, often labeling it as promoting terrorism. Human Rights Watch documented 1,050 takedowns of pro-Palestinian content by Meta in October and November 2023. Meta increasingly relied on AI-moderation systems that led to significantly reducing the visibility of pro-Palestinian posts, and to translating \u201cPalestinian\u201d into \u201cterrorist\u201d on Instagram. In a polarized social media space, every fact has become contested. It seems that for every investigation into an Israeli airstrike or a firefight, there is an alternative framing of events. When an Israeli airstrike most probably hit a convoy of civilians fleeing on an evacuation route, hundreds of pro-Israel users and accounts pretending they were open source investigators worked to shift the focus to videos of an unrelated side-road explosion for which they blamed Hamas. One such tweet was viewed more than 1.1 million times. On Feb. 29, Israeli troops fired at starving Palestinians trying to get food from an aid convoy in Gaza in an incident that saw more than 100 people killed and around 700 injured, with the precise breakdown between the number felled by Israeli bullets and those dying in the subsequent stampede unclear. Israel claimed all the casualties resulted from the stampede despite evidence showing that many casualties resulted from Israeli forces opening fire. The army released highly edited drone footage but did little to support Israel\u2019s contention about what happened. Pro-Israel accounts blamed civilians for threatening Israeli troops and tried to sow doubt about whether shots were fired. The pattern of information manipulation has repeated during several other incidents. As researchers and journalists rely on images from social media to conduct investigations, the widespread misinformation complicates their work and undermines their findings. Israel\u2019s social media campaign also seeks to push back against the country\u2019s anti-war minority and pander to the right-wing electorate. The government cracked down on critics by passing an amendment to Israel\u2019s anti-terrorism law criminalizing consumption of anti-war content on social media and threatening shutdowns of television channels and their websites. Journalists have been harassed by right-wing mobs By all appearances, Israel\u2019s social media strategy has been a tactical success. It has helped channel its supporters into one information universe, while leaving its critics and enemies in another. Within their bubble, Israel and its proxies can at the same time boast about the destruction of Gaza, deflect responsibility for their actions, and shrug off denunciations as missing the point. While the creation of social media echo chambers is not new, it is noteworthy that Israel\u2019s superior resources and technology has helped it insulate its supporters against a powerful and well-documented counternarrative. The strategy could be a case study for conflict parties in wars to come. Those who wish to prevent and resolve wars should also study it. After all, the more belligerents are able to disseminate parallel realities to their publics, the fewer opportunities there may be to make peace.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The Biden administration\u2019s delicate, much criticized line recognizes the lack of a coherent alternative strategy.",
                    "post_content": "Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the Biden administration has tried to toe a delicate line: backing Israel\u2019s war against the group in Gaza, while pushing Israel to ease the humanitarian toll of its operations and take the Palestinians\u2019 legitimate political grievances seriously. By all accounts, toeing this line has been a frustrating and thankless endeavor\u2014and, increasingly, a lonely one. Today, even the United States\u2019 closest allies are calling for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d that would put an end to Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza. At home, the White House is facing increasing pressure from Democrats in the U.S. Congress and parts of the Democratic base to change its current tactics in dealing with Israel. And yet, what the Biden administration understands\u2014and what Israel\u2019s many critics miss\u2014is that the international community cannot dictate a solution to Israel-Hamas war by fiat. If the international community wants Israel to change strategies in Gaza, then it should offer a viable alternative strategy to Israel\u2019s announced goal of destroying Hamas in the strip. And right now, that alternate strategy simply does not exist. There is a brutal logic to Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. By its own estimates, Israel has destroyed three-quarters of Hamas\u2019 battalions and killed two of five brigade commanders, 19 of 24 battalion commanders, more than 50 platoon leaders, and 12,000 of Hamas\u2019 30,000 foot soldiers. American intelligence estimates are lower, but not by much: Between 20 to 30 percent of Hamas\u2019 fighters and 20 to 40 percent of its tunnels are estimated to have been destroyed as of mid-January. It\u2019s also worth remembering that Hamas is structured more like a conventional military than a pure terrorist group. As a rule of thumb, conventional forces are considered combat ineffective once they lose more than 30 percent of their strength and destroyed once they lose 50 percent. Even if Israel does not stamp out Hamas entirely but merely succeeds in driving it out of power and underground, from Israel\u2019s view, that is still a win\u2014even if stops well short of its goal of destroying the group, for doing so would likely prove sufficient to prevent Hamas from launching another 3,000-man complex assault like the one Israel saw on Oct. 7. Finally, it\u2019s worth remembering that it took the United States several years to defeat the Islamic State. Israel is just over five months into what its leaders promised will be a very long war. To be sure, there are serious drawbacks to the Israeli approach. This war will encourage long-term radicalization of the Palestinian population, damage Israel\u2019s relationship with its Arab neighbors, and tarnish Israel\u2019s global reputation in a pretty serious way. Yet all of these problems are long term. Too often, states and politics live in the here and now. At the same time, Israel\u2019s critics have failed\u2014and continue to fail\u2014to offer a coherent alternative way forward. Instead, more often than not, there are vague references for the need for some ill-defined \u201cpolitical solution\u201d to the conflict. To the extent that there is a coherence to this alternate strategy, it revolves around using the threat of diplomatic isolation alongside economic threats that might force Israel to agree to an \u201cimmediate ceasefire.\u201d That ceasefire, in turn, would pave the way for a longer-term political settlement, likely around a two-state solution. Problem solved. Or not. For starters, international pressure and sanctions will not likely compel Israel to compromise. Israelis from the leadership on down are keenly aware that their country was born out of the ashes of Holocaust as a safe-haven for Jews after millennia of persecution. Israel then spent its first quarter-century fighting for its very existence. The idea that the world is aligned against Israel is deeply embedded in the nation\u2019s collective DNA, and chants of \u201cfrom the river to the sea,\u201d coupled with surging global antisemitism, only ensure that those fears remain very much alive today. Economic pressure\u2014such as sanctioning settlers or restricting military aid\u2014is unlikely to work, either. In general, sanctions have a poor track record of compelling states to abandon core national security interests. And given the Oct. 7 attacks, this war is nothing if not a core national security interest for Israel. Even if pressure did work initially, for a political solution to be sustainable, Israelis must voluntarily agree, not be pressured into it. But let\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument, that Israel caved to outside pressure and agreed to an immediate ceasefire. What would the day after look like? Hamas\u2014as Israel and Hamas both acknowledge\u2014would be left with a considerable military force, numbering in the thousands. Israel would then need to engage in another very lopsided deal to free the remaining hostages. In early February, Hamas wanted 1,500 prisoners freed from Israeli jails, including at least 500 serving life sentences for murder and other crimes, in exchange for the hostages. So, at minimum, the group\u2019s ranks would soon swell. And invariably, some of those released would be quite dangerous. After all, Yahya Sinwar\u2014the head of Hamas in Gaza and alleged mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks\u2014was freed from an Israeli prison, where he was serving a life sentence for murder, in the 2011 trade of 1,027 prisoners for one captured Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit. None of this recent history bodes particularly well for long-term peace. In all likelihood, Israel would respond to a ceasefire by tightening its blockade of Gaza, citing Hamas\u2019 continued existence as one reason for doing so. In particular, Israel would likely put severe limits on the quantities and types of building materials allowed into the Strip. After all, Hamas diverted an estimated 1,800 tons of steel and 6,000 tons of concrete to build its tunnel networks, and Israel would not want to see them rebuilt. The net consequence would be that desperately needed reconstruction would be severely delayed or\u00a0even brought to standstill. The fighting would not stop, either. Fearing that Hamas will make good on its promise to repeat the Oct. 7 attack \u201cagain and again,\u201d Israel would step up its\u00a0preemptive strikes on Gaza and the West Bank, particularly whenever it got the first whiff that Hamas might be planning an attack. At the same time, Hamas would continue to\u00a0attack Israel, if only\u00a0to reinforce its legitimacy and divert attention away from the likely dismal conditions in Gaza (thanks, in no small part, to the stymied reconstruction effort). In all likelihood, the situation would be right back where it started. Ah, but wait: Won\u2019t a two-state solution solve this? Probably not. Even before Oct. 7, the majority of Israelis didn\u2019t believe in a two-state solution, or that peace was even possible. There are likely even fewer who believe that now, especially if a Palestinian state were to include Hamas in some form.\u00a0Consider how unfathomable it would have been for most Americans to support the creation of a state with al Qaeda at its helm just five months after 9/11. There is no reason to believe that the Israeli public should be any different. Given considerable support for Hamas among the Palestinian population, it would be politically impossible to exclude Hamas from a new, democratic Palestinian government. And even if the new state\u2019s government is less than democratic, it would have trouble excluding Hamas entirely\u2014even if it wanted to\u2014if the group still has thousands of men under arms. But even assuming that overwhelming international pressure forced Israel to agree to a two-state solution, it\u2019s not going to guarantee peace in the short or medium term. There are still a host of thorny issues\u2014including borders, water rights, air rights, the demilitarization of the Palestinian state, and the partition of Jerusalem\u2014that would need to be resolved before a second state could come into being. Then there is the problem that only one-third of Palestinians favor a two-state solution themselves, and nine in 10 don\u2019t trust the Palestinian Authority. For its part, Hamas has made it abundantly clear that it wants one state without Jews under an Islamist banner.\u00a0None of this means that the international community shouldn\u2019t push for a political settlement, but this is at best a long-term solution, not a near-term fix. If a two-state solution did come about, it may not bring an end to hostilities. Two states did not solve hostilities between India and Pakistan, or North and South Korea, or North and South Vietnam. Israel would be under no obligation to grant Palestinians\u2014now citizens of a separate country\u2014workers\u2019 permits, which would likely tank the nascent state\u2019s economy, just as it wouldn\u2019t have to provide electricity and other services to Gaza, as it did before the war. At the same time, Palestinians would rightly wonder why their state should be demilitarized and not entitled to the sovereign privileges of a \u201cnormal state.\u201d There would perhaps still be Jewish settlers living on the territory of the new Palestine, creating all sorts of problems. Absent genuine buy-in from both sides, a two-state solution would simply turn a local conflict into an international one. There is a lot to hate about Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. It is a bloody, destructive war that has killed far too many innocents and upended far too many civilian lives. It is by any measure a human tragedy that will reverberate across the region for years to come. But if the international community is not simply grandstanding and actually hopes to solve the tragedy playing out in Gaza, then it needs to begin by offering feasible solutions that address both Palestinian grievances and Israeli security concerns. To its credit, the Biden administration is at least trying to move in this direction. It is pushing Israel to curtail civilian casualties, set up safe zones, increase humanitarian aid, and move to a longer-term political solution\u2014all while still backing (or at least not outwardly opposing) Israel\u2019s ongoing operations to root out Hamas. Some might call such a balanced approach overly tactical and unable to quickly end the war, but a good strategy is built on sound tactics. Unfortunately, the Biden administration\u2019s nuance is the exception both internationally and in the domestic debate over U.S. policy. Just as the political right needs to be continuously reminded that the Palestinian population is not going anywhere and Israel cannot kill its way to victory, the political left needs to be reminded that Israelis are also not going anywhere and their equities must also be taken seriously. Ultimately, if Biden\u2019s critics on the political left want a different war, then they need to offer an alternative strategy and subject that strategy to the same sort of analytical rigor that it trains on Israel\u2019s current military effort. If not, the brutal logic of the current war will remain, and the ongoing tragedy will continue.",

                    "post_content": "Mounting civilian casualties and growing worldwide frustration with Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza have placed the U.S. government in a difficult position. Washington backs Israel in its offensive against the Islamist group to degrade its military capabilities and prevent another serious attack against Israeli territories and civilians. However, the Biden administration is no longer convinced that Hamas can be fully eradicated militarily. Instead, U.S. officials are interested in a pause in fighting that could lead to a formal end of the war, starting with a hostage exchange deal that plants the seeds for new political and administrative arrangements in Gaza. While cease-fire talks in Cairo have seemingly stalled due to Hamas\u2019s unrealistic demands and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s intransigence, the Biden administration appears determined to use the current crisis as a basis for a long-term arrangement that includes the recognition of a Palestinian state. There is concern about the fate of Hamas and what remains of its governance, control, and militant assets after hostilities end. Scenes from Gaza of areas vacated by Israel Defense Forces ground troops, particularly in the northern part of the coastal enclave, have shown several instances of Hamas reappearing in supposedly cleared zones, demonstrating the group\u2019s potential for surviving the war. The risk of going back to business as usual after this war terrifies me. I am originally from Gaza. I have lost more than 31 of my family members who were killed by IDF airstrikes in Gaza City and Rafah. Both of my childhood homes are gone. My immediate and extended family are all homeless, having had to regularly flee in pursuit of safety. This personal dimension is precisely why I\u2019ve been desperately seeking pragmatic ideas, outlined below, that address humanitarian aid provision and the stabilization of post-war Gaza through new security arrangements. This is not an intellectual or analytical issue for me. It is an existential one that threatens the survival of what remains of my family in the Gaza Strip and the preservation of the territory that I once called home. While the Biden administration and the United Kingdom are reportedly exploring options for recognizing a Palestinian state, such recognition is unlikely to change much on the ground. What is needed now, more than ever, is an effort to use Gaza as a model for Palestinian statehood and sovereignty. There is a unique opportunity now, before the implementation of a cease-fire agreement, no matter how long a pause in fighting lasts, to force Hamas to agree to steps that are more likely to result in a path forward. Such a path would allow for Gaza\u2019s redevelopment and political transformation as part of an incoming Palestinian state. Doing so will require applying maximum pressure on Qatar, which is Hamas\u2019s sole political ally capable of making the group moderate its demands during hostage and cease-fire negotiations. After all, Qatar is not only negotiating on behalf of Hamas but is also hosting the group\u2019s senior political leadership and was the group\u2019s financial lifeline before the Oct. 7 massacre. Additionally, Al Jazeera Arabic has for years been the primary media platform for promoting Hamas\u2019s narratives and bolstering the group\u2019s propaganda which entrenched Hamas\u2019s control over Gaza. The U.S. must exert its influence over Qatar, including by leveraging the presence of the Al Udeid Air Base and threatening to move the facility (to Bahrain or Saudi Arabia), which has provided the oil sheikdom with stability. The base has shielded Qatar from threats by its neighbors, who were irritated with Doha\u2019s policies and pro-Islamist interventions around the Middle East. Al Udeid has also ensured that the small country stood a chance against future Iranian aggression or bullying since both share the world\u2019s largest natural gas field. Qatar\u2019s foreign policy is partially built upon the stability that it has from U.S. protection and backing. A threat to this cornerstone of the country\u2019s U.S.-dependent security architecture is far more dangerous than abandoning Hamas, which is increasingly becoming a geopolitical headache. Most importantly, the pending Saudi-Israeli normalization of relations is an immensely valuable and rare opportunity to pressure the Israeli government into worthwhile concessions that can incentivize the Palestinian leadership and public to adopt a new roadmap going forward. Such a new path must either force Hamas to change its political stance or risk becoming irrelevant and marginalized in the Palestinian national movement for self-determination and statehood. Unfortunately, given the likelihood that such a deal could take some time, the most pressing need right now is to address the sheer scale of the humanitarian crisis brought upon by the continued fighting and the widespread destruction that has befallen Gaza. Not only is the aid being brought into Gaza inadequate, but the distribution of such aid has failed to reach large segments of the displaced and isolated population, particularly in the north. Because the international community had to scramble overnight to figure out how to bring in supplies and aid through Egypt instead of Israel, which blocked any aid going in for the first month of the war, the current framework has not been able to allow for the entry of vast categories of goods and materials that are necessary. The present system of truck convoys and centralized delivery and distribution through a single entry port\u2014Rafah in the south\u2014and to a limited number of locations is unsustainable and inherently inadequate. The expansion of the war to Rafah, home to most of the strip\u2019s displaced civilians, risks catastrophic consequences for people who are trapped and inhumanely squeezed between the Israeli military forces and tightly sealed Egyptian borders. One of the primary failures of Israel\u2019s military operation is that it has outsourced dealing with the humanitarian consequences of its assault to the international community and NGOs when it could have played a productive role by providing and delivering needed aid itself. Creative and daring steps are needed to mitigate human suffering, especially if a cease-fire agreement falls apart, the war persists for more months, or if Israel proceeds with a full invasion of Rafah, which is the last safe haven for most of Gaza\u2019s displaced civilians. Here are five pragmatic options that should be rapidly implemented: 1. Humanitarian clusters in the North: Displaced civilians from the northern parts of Gaza must be given the option to return to what remains of their homes. The IDF\u2014with U.N., Arab, and international support\u2014could help set up humanitarian clusters, which should be safe zones that are dispersed across multiple parts of northern Gaza, particularly in open areas outside major urban centers and especially near the Mediterranean coast. Clusters should have a combination of temporary housing units, tents, field hospitals, food and aid distribution centers, bathrooms, electric-charging stations, and makeshift support centers with social, psychological, and other logistical and administrative services and support.\u00a0 2. Provisional seaport: The Israeli government has explicitly stated that it would allow for the establishment of a maritime corridor that connects Gaza with Cyprus. This would entail Israeli inspections of Gaza-bound ships with aid and humanitarian supplies to dock on Gaza\u2019s shores if a capable partner could receive the cargo. France has expressed willingness to send a temporary naval hospital that could dock on Gaza\u2019s shores. The details of how this would be implemented are still unclear. In the past, Turkey offered to send power-generation ships to Gaza, just as they have offered the same to Ukraine after Russia\u2019s attacks destroyed a significant portion of Kyiv\u2019s electrical grid. The most suitable location for a provisional seaport in Gaza, which can be next to a series of humanitarian clusters, is the coast adjacent to the Al Zahra area, south of Gaza City. If this were to happen, it would be a transformative leap in the quantity and quality of aid delivered to Gaza\u2019s desperate civilian population. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) can be an especially helpful and viable partner in quickly implementing and managing such a seaport, given the country\u2019s vast expertise in managing ports through the state-owned DP World corporation. 3. Dispersed airdrops and designated airdrop zones: Because of the damaged infrastructure throughout Gaza and due to logistical and distribution problems, airdrops can improve aid and food accessibility across the Gaza Strip, particularly in the north. Dispersed airdrops increase the chances of civilians quickly retrieving food and aid parcels instead of relying on trucks that are easier to intercept, loot, or rob en route to distribution sites. Although airdrops are less efficient than land or naval corridors, they are effective in reaching isolated populations. In building upon the humanitarian clusters model, airdrops can also be done in specific areas that are secured and afforded protection to ensure that food and aid supplies are quickly distributed to needy civilians. The Jordanian, French, and Dutch air forces have already conducted a few small airdrops over northern Gaza, in full coordination and cooperation with the IDF. The U.S. and the World Food Program can play a vital role in these large-scale airdrops. Additionally, the UAE, which hosts a massive U.N. Humanitarian Response Depot and has suitable aerial assets and effective diplomatic relations with Israel, can also be a key partner in carrying out food airdrops over northern Gaza which is currently facing famine-like conditions. \u00a04. Interim Egyptian and Jordanian security and police support forces: Hamas elements are starting to reemerge in parts of the strip that the IDF has vacated, and a future Hamas-run Gaza must be avoided. To that end, Egypt and Jordan could be considered as viable partners in providing an interim security solution. These two countries are uniquely positioned to enter the Gaza Strip and provide provisional security support services to help stabilize the coastal enclave and help secure humanitarian aid and enable the gradual reconstruction of Gaza, opening the strip to international NGOs, private enterprise, and foreign governments. These interim forces can enter Gaza now, even while the war is going on, and be confined to specific areas that the Israeli military has vacated throughout Gaza. Egypt and Jordan are severely debt-ridden nations that have effective military and security forces and could be offered significant financial incentives to make their participation worthwhile. Notably, both share cultural ties to the Palestinians. Importantly, such forces should not fulfill a counterterrorism role on behalf of Israel. To ensure that Egyptian and Jordanian peacekeepers are not viewed as subcontractors for the IDF, their focus must be exclusively on providing security that prevents chaos in areas where the IDF withdraws, ensuring that Gaza has an opportunity for a stable future. Ultimately, their presence will prevent Hamas from reconstituting and reasserting its executive and administrative control. Through a political agreement that Qatar can help arrange with Hamas, these forces can operate without fear of becoming targets for Hamas\u2019s militants. If the Islamist group is pressured by Qatar into making a decision to allow the entry of this interim force as part of Hamas\u2019s potential political rehabilitation, including abandoning violence, most of Hamas\u2019s members will adhere to this arrangement. While getting Hamas to accept this force could be difficult, the group has a strategic incentive to survive politically and remain relevant even if that means giving up control over Gaza. The U.S. can provide funding and other forms of support to Egyptian and Jordanian security and police forces entering Gaza.\u00a0 5. A new professional Gaza security and police force: While the Egyptians and Jordanians can help in a provisional capacity to secure Gaza and ensure that humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts are carried out in cleared zones, the U.S.\u2014in cooperation with Arab and international partners\u2014must quickly support the establishment of a new Palestinian-staffed and internationally monitored security force for Gaza. Such a force will focus largely on controlling areas that are vacated by the IDF to secure various parts of the strip while ensuring that control of such zones does not fall back to a reconstituted Hamas government. The United States Security Coordinator (USSC) based out of Jerusalem can play a pivotal role, as it already has with training Palestinian Authority forces. To reduce friction with the Netanyahu government, control and jurisdiction of such a force should not be under the Palestinian Authority. Instead, it should fall to other parties such as the Arab League, the European Union, and elements of the United Nations. The initial core of recruits would come from the West Bank. However, for this force to be sustainably welcomed and accepted by Gazans, it must be constituted by Palestinians from Gaza, who should play a central role in their own policing and security. Egypt and Jordan can play a positive role in slowly introducing this new force to areas around Gaza to ensure it is not perceived as coming on the backs of Israeli tanks. Most importantly, West Bank recruits must not be politically affiliated with Fatah to minimize the inflaming of past grievances from the Hamas-Fatah conflict. Stabilizing the Gaza Strip and relieving some of the unspeakable misery and pain that Gazans are experiencing are fundamental to ensuring that floated and existing \u201cday after\u201d plans have a chance of being implemented. Gaza should not be a citadel of Hamas and Palestinian resistance. Instead, it should become a blueprint for a Palestinian state that ultimately has jurisdiction over both Gaza and the West Bank. Despite its small size, Gaza has enormous potential to become a hub of Palestinian economic, cultural, and democratic development. The coastal enclave sits by a promising gas field that could finance its future growth and evolution, for example. Furthermore, Gaza overlooks the Mediterranean and could become a Palestinian gateway to the rest of the world through maritime corridors. The strip could even have an airport, as it once did. A recent proposal by Jerome Segal in Foreign Policy argued that a \u201cGaza-first\u201d model should be adopted when it comes to recognizing Palestinian statehood and sovereignty. He rightly acknowledges Palestinian trepidation about \u201cGaza first\u201d turning into a \u201cGaza last\u201d scenario in which progress towards Palestinian statehood stops in the coastal enclave due to Israeli intransigence or other obstacles. However, this may be the only path forward in which trust between the Palestinians and Israelis, especially after the horrendous Oct.7 attacks, is gradually rebuilt and reestablished. This is especially necessary after the failures of the Oslo peace process, the expansion of Israeli settlements, Hamas\u2019s violent terror in Gaza, and Netanyahu\u2019s insistence that the formation of a Palestinian state is an inherent threat to Israel\u2019s secure future. Amid the unprecedented death and destruction in Gaza, pragmatic steps could sow the seeds for an entirely different and better future that gives hope to an utterly hopeless and battered population. The U.S. must quickly use its power and leverage to pressure the relevant parties into taking rapid and meaningful action to secure the release of the Israeli hostages and end the war in a way that initiates such a transformation in Gaza. Failure to reverse the unfolding catastrophe in the strip will ensure the continuity of violent extremism, whether carried out by Hamas or an even deadlier mutation that feeds off the misery and hopelessness of the Gaza\u2019s civilians.",

                    "post_content": "Standing on the speaker\u2019s dais inside the Palestinian Legislative Council, three dozen Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers held up an Israeli flag. The IDF soldiers captured the building in mid-November, as they swept through Gaza City and took control of key government buildings while pushing out civilians across the territory. It was stark juxtaposition to the scene inside the chamber 16 years earlier, when it was Hamas who seized control of government buildings throughout Gaza. Brandishing rifles, they forced out Fatah, their political rivals, and asserted total control over the Gaza Strip. A decade before that, the Palestinian Authority held its first elections to fill the chamber. While there were limitations, the elections successfully created a functioning government for the Palestinian proto-state, armed with a mandate to both improve the standard of living in the territories and to negotiate a permanent deal for independence with Israel. There was reason to be optimistic. Today, the legislative council building lies in ruin. Shortly after the Israeli forces posed for photos inside, the complex was partially razed. The building\u2019s destruction also symbolizes a chance to try again. But in order for the PA, or whatever replaces it, to succeed, it will need a mandate from the Palestinian people\u2014something it hasn\u2019t had in more than 15 years. It\u2019s a tall order. Restoring democracy to Palestine is a collection of Catch-22s. It needs a new government to function, but its current politics have long been too fraught to hold elections. It cannot have real elections without Hamas, its most popular party, but Israel will not tolerate any government which includes them. Its electoral infrastructure is sound, but its political system is woefully broken. For the far-right coalition in power in Israel, led by long-term political survivor Benjamin Netanyahu, a divided Palestinian community is far better than one with a clear democratic leader. Yet holding any real election will need both cooperation and security assurances from the Israeli government and support from the international community. With respect to the United States, a likely broker of any deal, their hesitant inching toward an independent Palestinian state cannot come fast enough. Untangling these problems may seem impossible amid a siege in which hundreds of Palestinians are still dying weekly. But true representation and a path to real statehood for Palestine are vital to any lasting peace. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is yet thinking of how we restart political competition in Palestine,\u201d said Vladimir Pran, an elections specialist who previously served as director of the International Foundation for Electoral Systems for Palestine. \u201cI would argue it\u2019s important, it\u2019s condicio sine qua non, when it comes to good governance and democracy.\u201d In the months since Oct. 7 and the ensuing war in Gaza, the international community has played variations on a theme when it comes to governance in Palestine. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu told NPR that \u201cthere has to be a civilian government\u201d in Gaza, but implied that it would not be the government in Ramallah. Yair Lapid, who leads the Israeli opposition, said the PA should be the one to take over Gaza, but only after it goes through a \u201cde-radicalization process.\u201d In a Washington Post op-ed, U.S. President Joe Biden wrote that \u201cGaza and the West Bank should be reunited under a single governance structure, ultimately under a revitalized Palestinian Authority.\u201d Now the White House is toying with a plan for an independent, but \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d Palestine. The European Commission\u2019s foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, put it in more blunt terms: \u201cThe Palestinian Authority has to return to Gaza.\u201d Specifics, however, have been in short supply. A State Department spokesperson confirmed to Foreign Policy that the White House supports the PA regaining control of Gaza. Asked how they ought to happen, the spokesperson said that decision should be up to the Palestinian people. Zaha Hassan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who previously represented Palestine in international negotiations, says there\u2019s a hollowness at the heart of this language. \u201cWe need to clarify what the U.S. and others are talking about when they talk about a \u2018reformed\u2019 or \u2018revitalized\u2019 Palestinian Authority,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing, in their minds, as a legitimate Palestinian Authority\u2014one that is going to represent the will of its people.\u201d An Egyptian plan, teased in December, tied together political and economic security. The proposal would see an immediate ceasefire, followed by the release of the hostages held by Hamas. The peace deal would require that Hamas relinquish power in Gaza, to be replaced with an administration of technocrats. That new government would plan and hold fresh legislative elections to bring democratic government back to the Palestinian territories. A plan from a broader coalition of Arab states, reported by the Financial Times in January, would see the establishment of a recognized Palestinian state, under some form of a \u201cstrengthened\u201d PA. (Netanyahu, for his part, continues to oppose any sovereign Palestinian state.) These reports feel like a historical rerun. After Hamas\u2019s 2007 coup, Mahmoud Abbas declared a state of emergency and appointed U.S.-educated economist Salam Fayyad as caretaker prime minister until fresh elections could be held. Fayyad, a member of the small Third Way party, was hailed by then President George W. Bush as \u201ca good fellow.\u201d But his appointment never engendered real legitimacy. \u201cYes, fine. Everybody loved Salam Fayyad, the Americans love Salam Fayyad,\u201d Pran said. \u201cThe Palestinians hated it. They saw him as an American accountant, imposed on the Palestinians.\u201d According to Israeli broadcaster Kan, American diplomats have again put forward Fayyad\u2019s name as a candidate to helm this hypothetical renewed PA. (Fayyad says he has not been part of those discussions.) \u201cWe are constantly trying to apply frameworks and solutions on the Palestinians, completely oblivious and ignoring their internal politics and their internal political dynamics,\u201d Pran said. \u201cYou can\u2019t freeze politics out of political systems.\u201d \u201cAll this talk about post-Gaza [war], the day after, when you strip away the fantasy scenarios, we\u2019re back where we were a year ago,\u201d Pran said. And the problem is: Succession planning for Abbas, the president of the PA. It was clear, even long before Oct. 7, that Abbas, now 88, needed to be replaced. But there has been no clear indication of who will step into his shoes. It is almost certain that his successor will need to be chosen before any election can be called. That makes the internal machinations of Fatah critically important. One faction inside Fatah clearly still favors a return to a national unity government, which would include Hamas. That faction includes one possible Abbas successor: Jibril Rajoub, the secretary general of Fatah\u2019s Central Committee, who had previously tried to revive the Fatah-Hamas power-sharing deal. Another camp appears keen to freeze out Hamas and partner more closely with Israel and the United States. Hussein al-Sheikh, appointed by Abbas to serve as secretary general of the PLO, is seen as more deferential to Israel. \u201cIsn\u2019t it worth discussing how to manage this conflict with the Israeli occupation?\u201d al-Sheikh said in a December interview with Reuters. Hamas has branded him \u201cspokesman of the occupation.\u201d There is no clear path to reconcile these seemingly incompatible positions. No matter who replaces the aging Abbas, they will face the same problems as the longtime president: The Palestinian people see Fatah as corrupt, ineffective, and a barrier to Palestinian statehood. Hamas won the 2007 elections for exactly that reason. And the terror group\u2019s popularity has only grown since the Oct. 7 attacks: A poll from the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found Hamas\u2019s support nearly doubled as opposed to just months prior. Hamas has seized on the opportunity. At a press conference in January, Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s political leader, appeared alongside a member of Fatah\u2019s Central Committee and called for an end to the fighting between the two factions and for fresh elections. But the Palestinian Center\u2019s polling has also shown a deep malaise. When surveyed in person in June 2022, more than 7 in 10 Palestinians said they wanted fresh elections. Yet faced with the choice of either Abbas as Fatah\u2019s presidential candidate, and Haniyeh as the stand-in Hamas candidate, fewer than half said they would actually vote. Asked who they would like to see replace Abbas late last year, just 1 percent named al-Sheikh, while Rajoub\u2019s name didn\u2019t appear at all. There is one name, however, that was consistently named by a third of Palestinians as their preferred leader: Marwan Barghouti. The problem is that Barghouti has sat in an Israeli prison since 2002, serving consecutive life sentences. An Israeli court convicted Barghouti of murder and terrorism, but to many in the territories, he is Palestine\u2019s Nelson Mandela. There have been frequent pleas and campaigns to release Barghouti over the years, but they have all come to naught. Israel, Hassan says, has \u201cno interest whatsoever\u201d in releasing Barghouti. (He has long been at odds with Abbas and his loyalists as well.) As soon as the fighting stops or slows, there will be a desperate need for a functioning state in a devastated Gaza. Any attempt by Hamas to reassert control will likely be met with force from Israel, while the PA says it will not even try to return to Gaza unless a broader peace package is on the table. A longer-term Israeli occupation is unwanted and untenable, while a vague plan for an Arab-led peacekeeping force seems impractical and unlikely.\u00a0Palestinians, for their part, seem justifiably hostile to the idea of foreign powers setting their political agenda. In an open letter, a group of Gazan activists vowed to \"denounce and refuse any political discussions\" so long as Israeli military operations continue. One plan, put forward by Israel, would see the establishment of \u201ccivil committees,\u201d possibly approved by Israel directly, which would govern Gaza. The idea may be modeled after the \u201cvillage leagues\u201d initiative of the 1970s. Such a plan is likely to fail for the same reason the original incarnation did: Because local government cannot be imposed on a population by an occupying power. An increasingly likely possibility is that Gaza will simply have no government\u2014the PA may claim notional control, but Gaza will be essentially administered by a coalition of Western donors, as the Israeli Defense Forces manage its planned \u201cbuffer zone,\u201d clearing Palestinian territory and launching selective raids as it sees fit. Meanwhile, the Israeli blockade will continue. The Israelis will also need to sign off on any vote, Pran says. \u201cIf the Israelis don\u2019t facilitate those elections, then they really can\u2019t happen,\u201d Pran said. \u201cBecause the election commission cannot travel to Gaza, sensitive election material cannot be sent from the West Bank\u2014the ballot papers, you know, all that stuff\u2014training of officials: Really, nothing can happen if Israel wants to block those elections.\u201d \u201cIn terms of electoral process, I know this sounds paradoxical, but Palestinians have the best election commission in the Middle East,\u201d Pran said. &nbsp; The Palestinian Central Elections Commission, he says, is widely respected as neutral, independent, and capable. While there will be challenges for the commission going forward, it nevertheless represents a rare spot of credibility amid public frustration with the PA. One thing the rest of the world can do on this hypothetical \u201cday after\u201d is to ensure that the electoral commission is set up for success. \u201cNumber one, they have to update the voters list\u2014because the last update was done in 2021,\u201d Pran said. The massive displacement inside Gaza means that list will need significant revision. The Palestinian people seem keen for political choices beyond Fatah and Hamas. The current law, however, makes founding a new competitive party essentially impossible. Reforming the electoral system to allow for real multiparty democracy could be one way to disrupt Fatah\u2019s hold on power while offering an alternative to Hamas. Luckily, much of the work has already been done. The United Nations Security Council released a road map to a two-state solution in 2003, including political reforms. Focusing on how to get a real political process started in Palestine will be vital for a lasting peace\u2014but it requires buy-in from actors who often loathe each other. Failure will doom Palestinians to another generation of political corruption, dysfunction, and unrealized aspiration. The Palestinian people want and deserve better.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Urban warfare has always been brutal for civilians\u2014and the war against Hamas was destined to be an extreme case. ",
                    "post_content": "As of the middle of February, the Gaza Health Ministry reported more than 28,000 Palestinians dead in the war precipitated by the murder, rape, and kidnapping conducted during Hamas\u2019s raid on Israeli border settlements and towns on Oct. 7, 2023. Press accounts estimate that in the northern Gaza Strip, almost 80 percent of buildings may be damaged or destroyed. To avoid being caught up in the most intense fighting, according to the United Nations, as many as 85 percent of the 2.2 million people in Gaza may have left their homes as of mid-December. The scale of death and destruction arising from Israel\u2019s legitimate counterattack has precipitated charges of war crimes and genocide against Israel in the International Court of Justice. The Israeli government has claimed that it is adhering to its well-developed system for assessing combat in light of the laws of war. But if that is the case, then why has the Israeli offensive produced so much damage and death? One answer is simple. When war is fought among civilians, civilians are killed. Among the most poignant examples is from World War II: the number of French citizens killed by Allied bombing in the months prior to the June 1944 Normandy invasion. The allies bombed lines of communication heavily to prevent the Germans from reinforcing their coastal defenses along the English Channel. Historians suggest that some 20,000 French civilians who had the misfortune of living near ports, bridges, roads, or railroad infrastructure were killed in these attacks and during the subsequent two months of ground and air operations. Some would say that this is ancient history; we would never do that again. But more recent history suggests that, though modern weapons are considerably more accurate and procedures in Western militaries to avoid collateral damage are more formalized, fighting among civilians, especially in urban areas, always means hell on earth for the civilians who may be trapped there. In 2016 and 2017, a U.S.-led counterterrorism coalition and its Iraqi and Syrian (mainly Kurdish) allies aimed to destroy the Islamic State and eject it from the larger cities that it held in Iraq and Syria\u2014first Mosul, and then Raqqa. These battles were immensely destructive, despite coalition efforts to mitigate civilian harm and the United States\u2019 possession of a lavish supply of the most accurate weapons ever produced. Like the U.S. and its allies in Iraq and Syria, Israel chose as its objective the destruction of its adversary. That\u2019s why those earlier wars provide important insights into what Israel knew it would face in Gaza, and they help to explain its military strategy, tactics for the campaign, and the level of death and destruction that we have witnessed. The campaign to destroy the Islamic State in Mosul lasted from October 2016 to July 2017. Nearly 94,000 Iraqi troops attacked an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 Islamic State fighters. As many as 29,000 aerial munitions may have been employed by the United States and its partners during the fight, plus uncounted artillery shells fired mainly by Iraqi security forces. Of a pre-battle population of roughly a million people, an estimated 9,000 to 11,000 civilians died, at least a third of them from coalition fire, a third due to Islamic State actions, and a third from causes that are impossible to attribute. Roughly 9,900 structures were damaged or destroyed, including some 65 percent of residential construction. The Raqqa campaign, which lasted from June to October 2017, is particularly instructive because it was conducted almost entirely under U.S. control. Between 30,000 and 40,000 Syrian and Kurdish militia members fought between 2,900 and 5,600 Islamic State fighters. The militias that did the ground fighting had all been organized and armed by the United States. Most of the air and artillery support was provided by Washington, with some assistance from allies, and the United States attempted to hew closely to the laws of armed conflict. To somewhat reduce the destructiveness of the campaign, the largest bombs employed were in the 500-pound category. U.S. Air Force figures suggest that as many as 15,000 aerial munitions were employed against targets in Raqqa during those five months, with U.S. Marine Corps artillery adding 35,000 155 mm artillery shells (perhaps 1,750 tons of shells) to the mix. Raqqa was also bombed and shelled heavily prior to the 2017 offensive. But after the campaign was complete, the bodies of roughly 4,100 civilians were found under the rubble, along with those of some 1,900 individuals wearing \u201cmilitary gear.\u201d Nongovernmental organizations estimate that somewhere between 774 and 1,600 of the civilian casualties were caused by coalition fire. And approximately 11,000 building structures were damaged or destroyed, rendering 60 percent to 80 percent of the city uninhabitable. In Raqqa and Mosul, most civilians seem to have perished due to building collapses caused by bombs and shells, but in Mosul, the ratio of damaged buildings to civilian deaths was about 1-to-1, whereas in Raqqa, it was about 3-to-1. Though they are cautious in their conclusion, analysts at the Rand Corp.\u2014a U.S.-funded think tank\u2014attribute the lower rate of civilian casualties per building in Raqqa relative to Mosul mainly to one simple factor\u2014a very high percentage of Raqqa\u2019s pre-battle civilian population of roughly 300,000 people left the city, some prior to the battle and some during it. Hamas presented Israel with a very difficult military problem, even more difficult than Mosul or Raqqa. The degree of difficulty explains a lot about the terrible trajectory of the Israel-Hamas war. (Reasonable questions have also been raised about the impact of how IDF military lawyers interpret provisions about civilians in the standard international treaties on the conduct of warfare\u2014while there is not much evidence that the IDF deliberately targets civilians, some of the destructiveness may be explained by an overly broad interpretation of proportionality and precaution measures.) Whatever else one can say about Hamas, it is a capable and ruthless adversary. The IDF faced four main problems in starting its operation\u2014the size and quality of the Hamas military force; the urban environment; Hamas\u2019s comprehensive preparation of the terrain, especially including hundreds of miles of tunnels and deeply buried bunkers; and Hamas\u2019s systematic integration of its troops and prepared defenses with the civilian population. The size and quality of the Hamas military force creates a major problem in its own right. Observers estimate that at the outset of the fighting, Hamas had between 15,000 and 40,000 soldiers, with its actual combat power reportedly concentrated in five brigades. At minimum, this is three times the combat power that the Islamic State had in either Mosul or Raqqa\u2014on the higher end of the estimate, more than 10 times the Islamic State\u2019s combat power. This alone would produce a significantly more difficult and destructive offensive campaign. (As another point of comparison, it is estimated that 8000 Ukrainian troops, in perhaps four small brigades, defended Mariupol from a much larger and better equipped Russian force for three months in early 2022.) Hamas troops also appear to be well trained, and they benefited from advice by more experienced military experts, both from Hezbollah in Lebanon and from Iran. Hamas\u2019s forces, so far as can be known, are well equipped with light and heavy infantry weapons\u2014such as assault rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, shoulder-fired anti-tank rocket launchers, mortars, and anti-tank guided missiles. Hamas has manufactured and imported hundreds of artillery-type rockets, most of them unguided, and some with ranges as long as 150 kilometers (93 miles). Hamas also avails itself of commercially available off-the-shelf surveillance technology, including drones and digital cameras. If the well-equipped, armored forces of the IDF met these Hamas troops on a flat plain, they probably would make short work of them. But a well-trained and well-armed infantry force becomes formidable in an urban environment. The urban environment favors the tactical defense because it provides the defender with concealment, cover, and canalization. The U.S. military concluded as much following its experiences combating the Islamic State; one report released in September 2017 states that \u201c[e]xperiences in Mosul reaffirmed that urban terrain strengthens the defense.\u201d Buildings provide multiple hiding places. Basements offer not only hiding spots, but also natural bunkers, which can be used to shelter from enemy weapons and protect one\u2019s own fighters so they can shoot effectively. Where there are tall buildings, upper floors provide firing positions and unobstructed fields of fire for long shots down city streets, and they also enable observation of enemy movements. Streets and roads channel the movement of adversary forces; they are natural positions for an ambush. These attributes can easily be improved by defenders. Holes are knocked in walls within buildings to permit movement from room to room and building to building, obscured from view. Tunnels and trenches are also dug from building to building. Basements and upper floors can be reinforced with sandbags to protect against bullets and shrapnel, as well as with vertical steel and wooden beams to prevent ceiling collapse. Bunkers and firing positions are often built in the interior of buildings, with weapons sighted through holes cut in several layers of interior and exterior walls to confuse the targets about the source of fire. Entrances and stairways are mined and booby-trapped against infantry assault. Because of the urban environment and the ease with which it can be improved, the defender usually has another line of defensible positions to which it can retreat under pressure, starting the whole process of attack and defense over again. There was no shortage of materials available to Hamas to improve its defenses despite an ongoing Israeli blockade. United Nations statistics show that significant quantities of construction material were imported into Gaza in the past nine years\u201450,000 truckloads permitted in 2022 alone, making up 50 percent of supplies arriving in the enclave, whereas only 25 percent of deliveries contained food and 4 percent contained humanitarian supplies provided by international organizations. Given the group\u2019s administrative control over Gaza, it would be surprising if the construction efforts thus supplied were not influenced by Hamas, and that materials were not skimmed from civilian projects to support underground construction of bunkers and tunnels. The effect of an urban environment on offensive operations is almost always an increase in the attacker\u2019s reliance on firepower. In Raqqa, the United States and its partners relied heavily on precision-guided weapons, bombs, missile, rockets, and artillery. They paid careful attention to the rules of war and often employed the smallest practical weapon to the target. (There seems to have been a hidden cost to this practice, because in Raqqa, three weapons were dispatched against each target on average, presumably to ensure that it was destroyed. Thus, the use of less destructive munitions seems to ensure that more munitions are fired to achieve the desired effect.) In these battles, the nature of the urban environment\u2014coupled with an experienced, committed, and well-armed adversary\u2014were enough to require the coalition to conduct a locust-like offensive on the coalition, in which these munitions, fired in support of advancing ground forces, gradually consumed Raqqa, just as they did Mosul. It should not be a surprise, therefore, that the IDF now finds itself destroying a great many structures in Gaza. Hamas further improved the urban environment with a vast subterranean construction project\u2014a deeply buried tunnel network that seems to serve both tactical and strategic purposes. Some tunnels link together fighting positions to support tactical maneuvers, surprise counterattacks and ambushes, and resupply efforts. Others permit leaders to move from their residences to their offices. Some lead to bunkers, which allow command and combat groups to work and rest underground. Presumably, other bunkers contain reserves of ammunition, including long-range rockets. And little has been said about where Hamas builds its weapons, but it seems likely that there are small fabrication facilities underground. As there are hundreds of miles of tunnels according to most sources, and the Israelis only show snippets of what they find, it could be that much of the network is pretty basic. But most of the videos and photographs that have emerged show what appear to be narrow but well- constructed, usually steel-and concrete-reinforced single file passages, while some tunnels are much wider. Living quarters and possible prisons have also been discovered. The tunnels have numerous camouflaged, vertical shafts for entrance and egress. It also appears that electric cables are strung along the ceilings, which provides power, but presumably also landline communication, allowing Hamas leaders to evade detection by Israeli intelligence. The inherent defensive possibilities of the urban environment, combined with a significant subterranean component constructed over many years, produced a vast fortress system. Though they certainly dug tunnels, a complex subterranean network like that built by Hamas fighters was unavailable to the Islamic State defenders of Mosul and Raqqa, creating vast new problems for the IDF beyond those experienced by the U.S.-led counterterrorism coalition. To try to take buildings and more importantly take the tunnel system solely through a series of tactical ground force engagements would not only take a great deal of time, but it would also immeasurably add to the ground force casualties Israel would have been likely to suffer. No military would embrace this prospect. Moreover, even a direct attack would be very destructive insofar as it would ultimately require the demolition of the tunnels from the inside out using large quantities of high explosives. We cannot know exactly how the IDF chooses which portions of Hamas\u2019s tunnel system to attack from the air, but any sustained attack would depend on bombs of great penetration capability and explosive power. (Western media has been critical of the IDF\u2019s use of one-ton bombs; CNN has analyzed more than 500 large craters in Gaza and found them consistent with those produced by underground explosions.) Because Hamas routes these tunnels under and into buildings throughout Gaza, Israeli attacks inevitably also produce damage on the surface. Though tunnels and underground bunkers are not the only target for the Israeli Air Force, their importance and ubiquity likely induce many of its strikes. The U.S. military, for example, encountered a large tunnel system near Saigon, called the \u201ctunnels of Cu Chi,\u201d during the Vietnam War. After years of indecisive attacks by ground forces, artillery, and tactical aircraft, the Washington loosed B-52 strategic bombers on the tunnel network in 1969 and finally destroyed most of it Observers can understand Israeli choices without endorsing them, or more importantly, supporting them. But they should understand the reasons for their opposition. Individuals can oppose Israel\u2019s war on the basis of their own morality, but the United States as a nation, given its own military history, including recent history, does not have much ethical ground to stand on in decrying Israeli strategy. Neither, for that matter, do Arab governments. Israel is not doing anything that the United States and its Arab allies have not done\u2014and done recently. Some may claim that Washington has had an epiphany and would never do this again, but such a claim is not credible. When the United States is provoked, it is historically quite ferocious. So-called collateral damage results. Hamas, for its part, appears unconcerned about putting Palestinian civilians in harm\u2019s way. Indeed, this is a feature, not a bug, of their political and military strategy. Some use the term \u201chuman shield\u201d for this strategy, but that is incomplete. This element of Hamas\u2019s strategy could also be described as \u201chuman camouflage,\u201d and more ruthlessly as \u201chuman ammunition.\u201d On a daily basis, the activities of civil society obscure Hamas\u2019s activities. More importantly, Hamas understands that civilian casualties are an Achilles\u2019 heel for Western military operations. Liberal democracies put a high value on the individual, and hence on every human life. Lawyers have developed an elaborate legal structure to regulate the conduct of warfare because of this respect for the individual, which is enshrined in international treaties. Western militaries, including the IDF, try to live by these laws, though the law of armed conflict does not proscribe them from waging war. They try to follow these rules in part because they reflect the values of the societies that they serve and in part because of an expectation of reciprocity, but also because pragmatically, they know that lots of civilian casualties can become a political liability at home and abroad. Hamas spends the lives of Palestinian civilians as ammunition in an information war. They are not the first to do so, and they probably will not be the last. The course of every urban campaign will be influenced by unique factors, but at the same time, they share similarities. When a capable defender, even in small numbers, has time to prepare a defense in an urban environment, the attacker will meet serious difficulties. The attacking force will always be interested in doing as well as it can at the least cost to itself, especially in terms of its own casualties. This means that it will bring not only all of its cunning to bear on the problem, but also that it will, as has generally been the case in modern times whenever the defense proves strong, bring lots of firepower to the fight. Urban offensives will therefore generally do very serious damage to buildings and infrastructure. If civilians are constrained to remain in these areas of intense combat, for whatever reason, they will suffer immensely, as have the civilians of Gaza. Cities have grown in size and density as the population of the planet has grown and as more and more people move to cities to be a part of the modern economy. The Israeli offensive in Gaza, the U.S.-led coalition offensives in Mosul and Raqqa, and even the bloody and clumsy Russian siege of Mariupol may not be anomalies. Instead, they are a window into future war. Rather than imagining pristine military operations, analysts and strategists should better understand the implications of failed diplomacy, or of conflicts simply left unsettled because diplomatic engagement in politically inexpedient. Few political disputes will be settled by invitational armored battles in empty plains and deserts. War is an extension of politics, and politics happen among people.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Washington\u2019s handling of the Israel-Palestine conflict appears to be hurting the president\u2019s credibility among African Americans.",
                    "post_content": "For decades, despite the diverse politics of the Black community, addressing Black voters\u2019 concerns with racial and economic domestic issues was enough to solidify the Black American vote behind the Democratic Party. But this is changing. President Joe Biden\u2019s reluctance to call for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war\u2014which has resulted in the deaths of more than 28,000 people in Gaza, over 150 strikes on U.S. troops in the Middle East, and in recent weeks the deaths of three Black service members in Jordan\u2014is leading more and more Black voters to question their support for the president. In the beginning of January, in an attempt to boost political morale among his most loyal constituency, Biden made an appearance at the Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina\u2014where nine Black Americans were gunned down by a white supremacist shooter in 2015. At this sacred site, it was fitting that Biden spoke about domestic issues such as racism and political violence. Unfortunately, Biden\u2019s foreign-policy woes followed him to the pulpit, where he was interrupted by protesters demanding a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Churches like Mother Emanuel AME play a key role in shaping the voting decisions of the larger Black community. More and more members of the clergy are speaking out from the pulpit against Biden\u2019s support for Israel. A recent New York Times article revealed that over the past several months more than 1,000 Black pastors\u2014ranging from conservative Southern Baptist churches to progressive nondenominational congregations in the Midwest and Northeast\u2014have called for an end to Israel\u2019s offensive operations in Gaza as well as the release of all hostages held by Hamas. As in other parts of the American public, much of the momentum behind Black faith leaders\u2019 calls for a cease-fire is coming from younger congregants. The growing discontentment with Biden\u2019s handling of the conflict was in some ways foreseeable. A Carnegie Endowment for International Peace survey of Black American opinion on the conflict conducted in October 2023, long before the death toll in Gaza had mounted, already revealed that 95 percent of Black Americans rejected the idea of \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Israel. Furthermore, while most Black Americans (65 percent) did not feel any worse about Biden in this early period of the conflict, Blacks under the age of 30 were 33 percent more likely to report feeling worse about the president compared to the rest of respondents. As one pastor in the swing state of Georgia stated, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard to persuade our people to go back to the polls and vote for Biden.\u201d This comes on the heels of polling that reveals that Black voters\u2019 approval rating for Biden in recent months is down nearly 20 percentage points. It is more and more difficult to view the mounting number of civilian deaths and worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza as being in line with the human rights commitments Biden ran on in 2020. The dip in enthusiasm for Biden is in part related to a feeling of Black-Palestinian solidarity among some of these disaffected Black voters. For others, lackluster support for Biden could also be a function of a limited appetite for yet another U.S. entanglement in the Middle East. For instance, the same Carnegie survey revealed that a quarter (24 percent) of Black respondents felt that the United States should not be involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict and that only 33 percent would be willing to send troops to the region if Israel was attacked by a neighboring state. It is fair to assume that the death of three Black service members in a drone attack near the Syria-Jordan border will conjure strong feelings about Biden\u2019s Middle East posture and the perennial human and material costs placed upon the Black American community in wartime. Black American news outlets such as the Amsterdam News, The Root, and Black Enterprise were quick to\u00a0note that the three service members killed were Black. On social media outlets such as X, many Black Americans are now wondering what the strategic purpose was for those soldiers being stationed there in the first place, and if Biden will be able to prevent more deaths of U.S. troops in an area where the United States is not actively at war. High rates of Black American military service, alongside the recent memory of the post-9/11 wars (which carried a price tag of $8 trillion), will weigh heavily on the minds of Black voters as they grapple with economic and racial issues domestically. If a community in which so many people have close relatives on active duty comes to believe that Biden\u2019s Middle East policy has led to increased attacks on U.S. troops (a point numerous pundits have come to argue), it is likely that this will influence Black voters\u2014many of whom have historically shown high levels of reticence toward the use of force abroad and see parallels to their own historic struggle for civil rights. As election season approaches, the Biden administration\u2019s well-timed appearances at fish fries, churches, historically Black colleges and universities, and Black sorority and fraternity events will not be enough to secure the Black vote\u2014as it did in 2020. This is especially true if the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to deteriorate before November. Recent statements by Black members of Biden\u2019s cabinet, such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, speaking out against Israel\u2019s handling of military operations in Gaza can be understood as an attempt to address those troubled by the worsening humanitarian situation in the region and to salvage Biden\u2019s reputation as a champion of human rights, a key component of his platform in the 2020 election. However, such statements will be for naught if members of the Black community do not see a change in Middle East policy. Since the turn of the century, Black American public opinion on U.S. military engagements has often foreshadowed broader public discontentment with poor foreign-policy decisions. For instance, Black Americans were among the earliest and most vocal groups raising concerns about the 2003 Iraq War\u2014now widely viewed as ill-fated. Unfortunately, foreign-policy experts have sometimes been slow to listen to Black American opinion on Washington\u2019s role in the world. If Biden is going to succeed in securing a second term, now is the time to do so.",

                    "post_content": "On Jan. 26, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague issued an initial ruling in South Africa\u2019s lawsuit accusing Israel of genocidal acts in Gaza. The court did not call for an immediate cease-fire, nor did it rule on whether Israel is in fact committing a genocide, but it did instruct Israel to take provisional measures to prevent genocidal acts. In its ruling, the court noted \u201ca large number of deaths and injuries, as well as the massive destruction of homes, the forcible displacement of the vast majority of the population, and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure.\u201d A less noted pillar of the case against Israel, however, is its systematic assault on Gaza\u2019s medical infrastructure. Since Hamas\u2019s horrific Oct. 7 attack, Israel has repeatedly targeted health care facilities, ambulances, and access roads. It has arrested health care workers, blockaded fuel needed for generators, and withheld critical medical and surgical supplies\u2014all of which are intended to undermine Gaza\u2019s health care system. There is a particularly cruel circular logic at play here: Israeli forces, as they bomb and besiege Gaza, are creating an urgent need for medical care among civilians while simultaneously denying them access to it. Israeli forces are far from the first to target health care. In Ukraine, where Russian soldiers damaged or destroyed nearly 700 health care facilities in the first 100 days of the full-scale invasion, these attacks drove the mass exodus of 5 million people. In Syria, attacks on health care were central to the forced dispersion of 14 million people. Government forces killed at least 831 health care workers between 2011 and 2023. Doctors took it upon themselves to build hospitals underground in opposition-held areas in the hope of avoiding deliberate bombardment by the Russian-Syrian military alliance. Israel\u2019s destruction of Gaza\u2019s health care system is not only an important part of the genocide charges\u2014it is also a blatant war crime that should be prosecuted outright by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has an active investigation underway of war crimes in Palestine. While the ICJ resolves disputes between states, the ICC adjudicates criminal prosecutions of individuals. Targeting health care achieves little militarily while amplifying the death toll and suffering caused by indiscriminate bombardment.\u00a0Such attacks flout the core purpose of international humanitarian law\u2014to relieve civilian suffering\u2014and are thus often an omen of broader atrocities to come. Israeli attacks on health care started in the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 assault. Within the first 36 hours, Israeli forces attacked the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia, Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, and Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, among several others, killing six health care workers in the process. While offering little proof, Israel routinely blames Hamas for fighting from civilian areas and institutions, yet Israeli forces have regularly deployed methods of warfare that are indiscriminate, impose a disproportionate cost on civilians, or both. By Nov. 24, 30 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals had been bombed, many repeatedly, even while medical staff, patients, and civilians seeking shelter remained inside. In addition to hospitals, Israeli forces have targeted ambulances, medical aid convoys, and access roads. As of Jan. 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 342 health care-related attacks in Gaza, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries. At this point, every hospital in Gaza is either damaged, destroyed, or out of service due to lack of fuel; only 13 hospitals are even partially functioning. Those hospitals, ambulances, and clinics that have survived bombing have been debilitated by blockades and obstruction of humanitarian convoys, depriving health care providers of not only water, fuel, and electricity but also critical medical supplies, such as oxygen, blood, and anesthesia. The staggering figure of more than 67,000 people injured in Gaza thus far doesn\u2019t begin to take into account the consequence of the routine medical care that is being denied to the civilian population. From childhood vaccinations to cancer treatment and dialysis, modern medical care has largely come to a standstill for 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza, whose life expectancy is already 10 years shorter than people living a few miles away in Israel and whose rates of neonatal, infant, and maternal mortality are nearly five times higher. Gaza\u2019s only hospitals providing treatment for adults and children with cancer, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital and Al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital for Children, have been bombed, besieged, and forced to close. Additionally, thousands of patients who previously received specialized treatment in Jerusalem that was unavailable in Gaza\u2014averaging 100 per day\u2014are now unable to access it. As the ICJ noted in its ruling, \u201csome 180 Palestinian women are giving birth daily amidst this chaos,\u201d often wherever they are sheltering rather than in any medical facility. Of these women, the WHO estimates, 15 percent are likely to suffer complications such as preterm delivery, obstructed labor, and postpartum hemorrhage. Without lifesaving cesarian sections and blood transfusions, women are more likely to die in childbirth. Without incubators, oxygen, surfactant, steroids, or antibiotics, newborns are more likely to suffer brain damage or die from sepsis or respiratory distress. The bombing and closure of Gaza\u2019s two rehabilitation hospitals mean that 441,000 people with preexisting disabilities\u2014constituting 21 percent of prewar households, a number that is now likely much higher\u2014have no place to receive care or access crutches, wheelchairs, or prostheses. Before the war, an estimated 71 percent of the adult population in Gaza had depression. According to UNICEF, at least 800,000 children in Gaza needed mental health and psychosocial support. Yet since the outbreak of war, the area\u2019s only psychiatric hospital was bombed, three psychologists were killed, and mental health services have been vastly reduced\u2014all while virtually the entire civilian population is being psychologically traumatized by the horrors of war. Making matters worse, the combination of forced mass displacement, unhygienic conditions caused by interrupted sanitation services and sewage treatment, and interrupted vaccination will inevitably drive disease outbreaks in the future, functionally resulting in a form of indirect biological warfare. Taken together, this deprivation of basic health care will only compound the death toll of this war beyond those killed by bombs, shells, and bullets. The Israeli government\u2019s ritualistic insistence that it complies with international humanitarian law is running thin in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence. The lawyers defending Israel in The Hague sought to deny genocidal intent by asserting that Israel is providing some medical supplies and services, including \u201csix field hospitals and two floating hospitals,\u201d as well as two more hospitals in the process of being built. But 15 of the court\u2019s 17 judges found those steps insufficient, citing U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019s assessment that the \u201chealth-care system in Gaza is collapsing.\u201d In mid-January, Qatar announced a deal in which Hamas agreed to deliver medication to the hostages in its captivity in return for a vow that \u201cmedicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in Gaza.\u201d Of course, it is wrong for Hamas to deny hostages the medicine they need, but that does not absolve Israel of blocking delivery of medicine to Palestinian civilians in Gaza and using their medical needs as a bargaining chip. Humanitarian law protects the right of even wounded combatants to seek medical care and requires allowing \u201crapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need.\u201d International humanitarian law already protects health care facilities outside of the context of genocide. These facilities lose protected status only if they are being used to commit an \u201cact harmful to the enemy.\u201d A past presence is not enough; a current threat is required. Israel has tried to defend its attacks on health care facilities by blaming Hamas for turning them into legitimate military targets, but given the paucity of evidence, the ICJ understandably found that excuse wanting. For example, the Israeli government repeatedly claimed that Hamas was maintaining a command center under Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, the largest hospital in the Gaza Strip. Yet when Israeli forces took over the hospital in November, all they could point to as evidence was a handful of rifles and a single tunnel\u2014possibly to the same bunker built by Israeli engineers when Israel last controlled the site\u2014in territory that is already permeated with Hamas-built tunnels. A Washington Post analysis of the evidence that Israel made public found it underwhelming. Today, Al-Shifa resembles a refugee camp and has been reduced to offering first aid instead of lifesaving clinical care. With no active Hamas presence, Israel\u2019s reasoning was insufficient to justify depriving the territory\u2019s population of an essential health facility. It was not only Al-Shifa. Human Rights Watch found \u201crepeated, apparently unlawful attacks on medical facilities,\u201d including \u201cthe Indonesian Hospital, al-Ahli Hospital, the International Eye Care Center, the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, and the al-Quds Hospital.\u201d Moreover, even if there were a military rationale, international humanitarian law prohibits\u2014in other words, considers a war crime\u2014attacks that are expected to cause civilian harm that would be \u201cexcessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\u201d\u00a0Shutting or occupying hospitals in Gaza, however, provides no such advantage, and the civilian harm inflicted on Palestinians there has thus far been immediate and crushing. When such civilian harm is \u201cclearly excessive,\u201d it is subject to prosecution by the ICC. Perpetrators of such unlawful acts (or those responsible for ordering the attack or with command responsibility) are subject to prosecution by the ICC. That harm was compounded by the manner in which the takeovers were carried out. As the International Committee of the Red Cross explains, \u201cprior to an attack against a medical unit which is being used to commit acts harmful to the enemy, a warning has to be issued setting, whenever appropriate, a reasonable time-limit and that an attack can only take place after such warning has remained unheeded.\u201d Instead, the Israeli military issued broad evacuation orders to entire regions of Gaza with minimal provision for safe passage or reception of those ordered to leave. As Human Rights Watch found, the \u201csweeping nature of the order and the impossibility of safe compliance, given that there is no reliably secure way to flee or safe place to go in Gaza, also raised concerns that the purpose was not to protect civilians, but to terrify them into leaving.\u201d Gaza is becoming increasingly uninhabitable, and drastic action will be required to stop\u2014and begin to reverse\u2014the enormous damage that has been done. But mere calls to protect hospitals and pronouncements that \u201chealth care is #NotATarget\u201d miss the point: These attacks could be part of a plan to make Gaza uninhabitable and drive Palestinians out, an outcome that senior Israeli ministers\u2014whose support Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs to remain in power\u2014continue to promote. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan\u2019s investigation so far has yielded only statements to the media rather than criminal charges. As he inevitably addresses the fallout of this war, he should include the assault on health care among the war crime charges. Punishing perpetrators of these attacks is the best way to prevent their proliferation\u2014in Gaza and, inevitably, beyond.",

                    "post_content": "In November 1988, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) met in Algiers and issued a Declaration of Independence, proclaiming the state of Palestine. The declaration grounded the new state in the 1947 U.N. Partition Resolution, which called for two states, one Arab and one Jewish. The PLO\u2019s goal, as with Hamas today, had previously been the \u201cliberation\u201d of all of Palestine, from the river to the sea. In the 1988 declaration, the PLO reversed that position. Four weeks later, the PLO recognized Israel\u2019s right to exist. Immediately following the proclamation, Algeria, the host country, announced its recognition of the state of Palestine. And almost immediately, the United States launched a worldwide effort to persuade other countries to withhold recognition and thwart the Palestinians in their campaign to gain admission into international organizations. Today, 139 countries recognize the state of Palestine, but this does not include the major Western democracies. The state is a member of many international organizations but not the United Nations, where the United States, through the Security Council, has blocked admission. Yet since 2012, Palestine has been recognized by the United Nations as a non-member observer state. Now, triggered by the war in Gaza, this may change. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, has stated that the United Kingdom is considering recognizing Palestine and supporting its membership in the United Nations. More importantly, it has been reported that this is also under consideration by the U.S. State Department. Prior to Oct. 7, 2023, recognition by the United States and admission of the state of Palestine to the United Nations would have been a major accomplishment for Fatah (the biggest secular Palestinian political party), the PLO, and for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who also holds the title of President of the state of Palestine. This would not have fundamentally changed the widespread Palestinian judgment that the entire Oslo Accords process was a disaster for the Palestinians, but it would have kindled a small spark of hope and would have counted for something in Fatah\u2019s struggle with Hamas, which replaced the PLO as the home for Palestinians who remained committed to liberating all of Palestine and to the use of armed struggle to do so. If it happens now, Hamas, whose popularity among Palestinians has grown and will grow further if there is a release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli hostages, will likely take credit. It will maintain that this recognition, which the PLO was not able to accomplish, demonstrates that only armed struggle produces results. And within Israel, such moves will likely increase the political fortunes of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. U.S. President Biden\u2019s advocacy of the two-state solution is already being used by Netanyahu as a central theme in his effort to win the next Israeli election, despite his dismal polling numbers. He claims that, were it not for him, Israel would be presently facing a Hamas-controlled state in the West Bank, and that only he can stand up to U.S. pressure. Key figures in the Israeli center who might challenge Netanyahu in the next election are sufficiently concerned that they have asked Washington to stop talking, at least in public, about the two-state solution. Unilateral recognition of Palestine by the United States would be used by Netanyahu in his efforts to stoke Israeli fears. That said, U.S. recognition of Palestine and its admission to the United Nations can be hugely important in the effort to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but to do so, such steps must be part of a comprehensive peace plan, one that acknowledges the new reality that Oct. 7 has created for Israelis. That day, Israelis underwent a trauma whose impact will endure. Israelis lost a sense of security that had long become part of their lives. They lost trust in their government and in their military, their intelligence services, and their technology. Hamas\u2019s slaughter awakened the historic memories of the Holocaust and of centuries of pogroms. Post-Oct. 7, no Israeli government will ever agree to a Palestinian state in the West Bank unless \u00adthere is substantial confidence that it will not be a threat to Israel. No set of written arrangements, including provisions that say the Palestinian state will be demilitarized, will supply Israelis with the degree of confidence that is necessary before they will risk a sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank. If there is an answer, it will require abandoning the defunct Oslo paradigm, which sees Palestinian statehood emerging as a result of successful end-of-conflict negotiations. The alternative is a sovereignty-in-Gaza-first approach: to test Palestinian statehood in Gaza first, and only if it is successful over an agreed period, to then move to negotiations on extending Palestinian sovereignty to the West Bank. The Gaza-first approach to Palestinian statehood has a long history. Its strongest Israeli proponent was Shimon Peres. Back in 1995, at Peres\u2019s request, I presented to Yasser Arafat a 20-point Gaza-first proposal I had developed. Arafat abruptly rejected it, not unreasonably, fearing that Gaza-first would become Gaza-last. But that was in the heyday of the Oslo Accords, when other paths to statehood seemed possible. Today, for Israelis, actual lived experience with a trial state in Gaza may be the only path to the two-state solution. Here are the main components of what a \u201cGaza-first plan\u201d might look like\u2014one that integrates U.S. recognition of the state of Palestine into a path to peace: The United States (or a group of Arab states including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Qatar) will put forward a plan for a trial Palestinian state in Gaza, with permanent status negotiations between Israel and the state of Palestine to be held only after a successful, three-year demonstration by the new state that it is stable, committed to peace with Israel, and has been successful in achieving de facto sovereignty over Gaza. The State of Palestine would have to attain respect for its authority from nonstate actors, especially Hamas. Hamas would have to relinquish its ability to initiate hostilities, including the possession of heavy weapons, missile production, and weapons smuggling. If the PLO accepts this Gaza-first test of Palestinian sovereignty, then the United States would stop blocking Palestine\u2019s admission to the U.N. and commit to recognizing the state of Palestine once it establishes de facto sovereignty over Gaza. The PLO or Fatah, under Arab auspices, would then begin negotiations with Hamas over the group\u2019s future. The goal will be agreement that once Israel withdraws from Gaza, Hamas will accept the authority of the Palestinian state. Further, agreement will be sought on conditions that Hamas-affiliated candidates will have to meet in order to participate in Palestinian elections, including acceptance of the Declaration of Independence\u2019s language that Palestine \u201crejects the threat or use of force, violence and terrorism, against \u2026 the territorial integrity of other states.\u201d If the PLO-Hamas negotiations are successful, Israeli forces in Gaza will be rapidly replaced by security forces from the Palestinian Authority. If they are not successful, then Palestine will receive assistance from other Arab states, or an international force, to establish its sovereign control of Gaza, leading to Israel\u2019s exit. Once the state of Palestine establishes control over Gaza, it would be recognized by the United States and Israel\u2014but with its recognized sovereignty, at this point, limited to Gaza. Upon Israeli recognition of the state of Palestine, the Palestinian Authority will cease to exist. All its administrative functions and assets and bureaucracy in the West Bank will be assumed by the state of Palestine. The emerging state will hold its first elections in both the West Bank and Gaza. All candidates for office will be required to meet the conditions discussed above. Upon the election of the first government of Palestine, the two states, Israel and Palestine, will exchange ambassadors and pledge peaceful coexistence. The United States will sponsor negotiations between the two states on lifting the blockade of Gaza and on how to prevent weapons smuggling into Gaza. To demonstrate that it is serious about future negotiations over the West Bank, Israel will also agree to a complete halt to the expansion of West Bank settlements, and to control and punish violence and intimidation of Palestinians by Israeli settlers. After the transfer of power to the state of Palestine, the settlement freeze, and the opening of negotiations on lifting the blockade of Gaza, Saudi Arabia will normalize relations with Israel. Upon a declaration by Palestine that it has attained de facto sovereignty over Gaza, the three-year trial period will commence. If it is successful, as judged by an implementation commission composed of the United States and the Arab countries that have recognized Israel, then Washington will convene permanent status talks between the two states. Those negotiations will be based on the final status parameters articulated by then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in 2016. These not only included the demilitarization of the Palestinian state and security provisions for Israel, but also a commitment that the borders of Palestine in the West Bank will be based on the 1967 lines, modified by equal land swaps, and with a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. Making Palestinian statehood a reality would allow Palestinian moderates to take over Gaza from the Israelis without appearing to be Israeli subcontractors or a police force furthering the occupation. Without this fundamental change in its role, the notion of a \u201crevitalized Palestinian Authority\u201d taking effective control of Gaza, as Biden has proposed, is delusional. Much will depend on the size and capabilities of Palestine\u2019s security forces. But most of all, success or failure will depend on whether the Palestinian people themselves believe that this statehood trial really offers a path to comprehensive independence. If so, succeeding in the trial will have widespread Palestinian support, and this in turn will affect Hamas\u2019s willingness to accept the authority of the state. Essentially, Hamas will be faced with a choice between marginalization or evolution. Ironically, this approach may also appeal to many Israelis who currently oppose a Palestinian state. This is because, apart from fierce right-wing ideologues, most of the Israeli opposition to a Palestinian state rests on the belief that real peace with such a state is not possible. For those firmly of this view, a Gaza-first test may appeal to them, if only because they believe that Palestine will prove to be a failed state. For the centrists seeking to lead Israel, a Gaza-first trial is a pragmatic option that serves to neutralize Netanyahu\u2019s claim that only he can prevent the imposition of a Palestinian state with West Bank sovereignty. Further, testing sovereignty does not tie Israel\u2019s hands if a Palestinian state is unable to gain actual sovereign power over Gaza. At the same time, a trial state in Gaza potentially offers Israel a chance that it would not otherwise have: a way to permanently withdraw from Gaza, rather than having to face an interminable insurgency. Gaining Saudi recognition of Israel by committing only to good-faith testing of Palestinian sovereignty will significantly enhance interest in the plan for all Israelis. For the moderate Palestinian leadership, this framework provides a major achievement towards a full end to the occupation, with actual sovereignty in some part of Palestine.\u00a0 And recognition by the United States will mean a Palestinian Embassy in Washington, a U.S. ambassador to Palestine, and worldwide acceptance of symbols of Palestinian sovereignty including passports and a currency. Palestinians will be wary, as Arafat was in 1995, that Gaza-first will become Gaza-last, but such fears will be alleviated by a permanent halt to Israeli settlement expansion. For those on both sides who are deeply committed to resolving the conflict, a Gaza-first approach provides an opportunity to demonstrate that lasting peace is possible, as well as an opportunity to develop new approaches to final-status arrangements outside the Oslo paradigm. Most importantly, it offers a credible path to the end of the conflict, without playing into Netanyahu\u2019s hands.",

                    "post_content": "KFAR AZA, Israel\u2014There is a pervasive sense in Israel that time stopped on Oct. 7, 2023. Kibbutz Kfar Aza, one of the first places Hamas attacked on that day, is now a closed military zone, frozen in time. A sukkah, or temporary hut erected for the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which took place the week leading up to Oct. 7, still stands in the yard of one house. In another, a cluster of children\u2019s bikes lean under a tree.\u00a0 In the home of Sivan Elkabetz and Naor Hasidim, a young couple in their early 20s, there are still dishes on the drying rack by the kitchen sink. Writing on the wall by the front door, scrawled in the aftermath of the attack, reads \u201chuman remains on the sofa.\u201d\u00a0 In the days after the attack, in which thousands of militants led and organized by Hamas streamed into Israel at daybreak on Oct. 7, raping, mutilating, and killing some 1,200 people and taking a further 253 hostage, much of the world rallied in support of Israel. Monuments from the Eiffel Tower to the Sydney Opera House were illuminated in the blue and white of the Israeli flag in solidarity with the country. Eight months later, much of that international outpouring of sympathy has given way to condemnation as Israel has waged an unsparing war in Gaza in a quest to root Hamas out of the coastal territory.\u00a0 A little over a mile to the west of Kfar Aza lies Gaza, where Israel is now embroiled in the longest war it has fought since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Amid the burned houses of the kibbutz on a recent morning in late May, a black anvil of smoke could be seen hanging over the the Gaza Strip, accompanied by the distant thud of artillery fire. \u201cIf you want to take a metaphor from a different conflict from around the world, Israel started the war as Ukraine, and seven months after, it\u2019s Russia,\u201d Shira Efron, the Israel Policy Forum\u2019s research director, said at an FP Live event last month.\u00a0 More than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run health authorities, which do not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Some 8,000 children have been killed, according to data shared by the United Nations\u2014a likely undercount as an untold number remain buried under rubble.\u00a0 The International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, has asked the court to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, alongside senior Hamas leaders, accusing them of having committed war crimes, including the use of starvation as a method of warfare. The United Nations has warned that a full-blown famine has taken hold in northern Gaza.\u00a0 But although Israel has grown increasingly isolated, the war is viewed in starkly different terms within the country, where many see the campaign in Gaza as one of existential necessity.\u00a0 \u201cFor us, it\u2019s a \u2018never again\u2019 war,\u201d said Avner Golov, the vice president of research and alliances at the Tel Aviv-based think tank MIND Israel. \u201cMy generation now faces a question that I never thought I [would] face, and this is whether a Jewish state can exist in the hostile Middle East,\u201d he added. \u201cWe need to make sure the answer is yes.\u201d While global attention has turned to Gaza, Israel is still mired in the trauma of Oct. 7 and the security failures that left thousands of people defenseless in the face of Hamas\u2019s onslaught. There\u2019s a creeping fear that the bloodshed of the attack is being forgotten or even denied.\u00a0 \u201cI feel like no one believes us enough,\u201d said Yarden Gonen, whose 23-year-old sister, Romi Gonen, was taken hostage from the Nova Music Festival. In a country of just under 10 million people, almost everyone knows someone who survived, was killed, or was taken hostage.\u00a0 Reminders of the 120 hostages who remain in Hamas captivity\u2014only about 80 of whom are thought to still be alive\u2014are omnipresent throughout Israel. Passengers arriving into Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport are confronted with images of the captives on biometric passport scanners, ATMs, and a phalanx of posters that line the ramp down to passport control. The media is filled with an agonizing drip of information about their fates.\u00a0 Hamas struck as Israel was embroiled in its most profound political crisis in decades over judicial reform proposals by the Netanyahu government that critics feared would undermine the country\u2019s vaunted independent judiciary. And though Israelis rallied together in the wake of the attack, that did not translate into greater support for Netanyahu, and frustration has only mounted over the government\u2019s failure to secure the hostages\u2019 freedom or present a viable path out of the war. Shmuel Rosner, a researcher with the Jerusalem-based Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI) who has been conducting weekly polls of Israeli public opinion, said there was no surge in government approval ratings in the wake of Oct. 7.\u00a0 \u201cThere was never a case in which a country was attacked by another country or by a terror organization in which the leadership of the country did not get not even one iota of bump in the polls,\u201d he said.\u00a0 But when it comes to critiques leveled by the international community, Israelis largely stand united, said Dan Illouz, a member of the country\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party who sits on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. \u201cOn almost all of the issues where the international community is trying to pressure Israel, those issues are not seen as political within Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous consensus within Israeli society on these issues.\u201d A Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and early April found that almost 40 percent of Israelis felt that the country\u2019s military response in Gaza had been about right, while just over a third felt that it had not gone far enough. The poll found sharp divides in the way Jewish and Arab Israelis see the war. Almost 75 percent of Arab Israelis, who make up around a fifth of the country\u2019s population, see the war as having gone too far, compared with 4 percent of Jews. \u201cI just came back from Canada and the U.S., and I saw that even very intelligent people adopted this thing of [the Gaza war being] \u2018Netanyahu\u2019s war,\u2019\u201d said Einat Wilf, a former Knesset member who served as a foreign-policy advisor to former Israeli President Shimon Peres during his tenure as vice prime minister. \u201cIt is Netanyahu\u2019s bungle\u2014I think he is in large responsible for it being so badly done,\u201d she added. \u201cBut the war? It\u2019s the war of our people.\u201d Part of that disconnect between Israeli and international perceptions of the war has to do with how the war is portrayed in the media. \u201cThe media here [in Israel] doesn\u2019t show what\u2019s happening in Gaza the way that other media does,\u201d said Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israel-Palestine with the International Crisis Group. \u201cSuffering in Gaza is just not a factor in the way this war is being narrated in Israel.\u201d International media has been awash with harrowing reports from Gaza of doctors performing amputations without anesthetic, of parents writing their children\u2019s names on their bodies for identification in the event they are killed. But although left-leaning Israeli outlets such as Haaretz and +972 have closely scrutinized the conduct of the war and the vast suffering it is causing for the millions of Palestinians living in Gaza, analysts say it has not featured prominently in the mainstream Israeli media. \u201cSeven months of Israel displacing, shelling, starving, killing, crushing and crowding together about 2 million people\u2014and on the Israeli channels there\u2019s nothing,\u201d Israel lawyer Michael Sfard wrote in an op-ed for Haaretz last month. Amid international outrage about the death toll in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) contends that it has gone to significant lengths to spare civilian life while fighting in exceedingly challenging urban terrain against an adversary that has deliberately entrenched itself among the civilian population.\u00a0 \u201cIsraelis by and large feel that the world puts too much emphasis on the humanitarian issue in Gaza and does not have proper consideration for the need for Israel to win the war and hence to fight in problematic urban areas,\u201d said Rosner of JPPI. \u201cIsraelis feel that the world does not appreciate enough the huge effort that the IDF is making not to harm innocent people, not to hit civilian targets.\u201d By the end of March, the IDF had dropped more than 9 million leaflets and sent 17 million voice messages warning civilians to evacuate ahead of its operations in Gaza, according to IDF data. \u201cThe army, in its very protocols, does much more than what is needed according to international law,\u201d said Illouz, who previously served as a legal advisor to the IDF.\u00a0 But longtime observers of the IDF, including some in Israel, counter that the military has, in recent years, loosened its rules of engagement, particularly in the current war. \u201cIt was very clear from the beginning that the IDF adopted new rules,\u201d said Yagil Levy, a professor at the Open University of Israel, who said he feared that the campaign was fueled by revenge \u201cin a most severe way\u201d in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack. Statements made by Israeli officials have also furthered the perception that the country\u2019s political and military leaders don\u2019t see as much of a distinction between Palestinian civilians and militants in Gaza as the rest of the world does. \u201cThough it is distinguished from the civilian population, Hamas is a Palestinian organization,\u201d said Capt. Adam Ittah, a spokesperson for the Southern District of the IDF\u2019s Home Front Command. \u201cThere is collective responsibility once you conduct such a massacre.\u201d Most controversial has been Israel\u2019s use of hundreds of heavy ordnance in Gaza\u2019s dense urban environments, including 2,000-pound bombs that are capable of killing and severely injuring people within a 1,000-foot radius.\u00a0 In the first two weeks of the war, around 90 percent of the munitions Israel dropped in Gaza were satellite-guided bombs of 1,000 to 2,000 pounds, according to a senior U.S. military official cited by the New York Times.\u00a0 \u201cEven a 500-pound bomb is too much in a densely populated area,\u201d said Wes Bryant, a retired U.S. Air Force master sergeant who led a U.S. strike cell against the Islamic State in Iraq. \u201cI could tell from the start that Israel, from the government to the IDF, was waging an emotional campaign.\u201d In early May, the Biden administration paused a shipment of heavy ordnance, including 2,000-pound bombs, to Israel as its troops planned to enter the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where U.S. officials have urged Israel to conduct a more targeted operation than those seen in the early phases of the war.\u00a0 The civilian death toll, Israel\u2019s throttling of humanitarian aid, and the killing of aid workers in Israeli strikes have placed enormous strain on Israel\u2019s relationship with its closest partner, the United States, which provides the country with billions of dollars of military aid annually.\u00a0 Eleven days after the Hamas attack, Biden touched down in Israel for an extraordinary wartime visit. In an emotionally charged speech, he drew on the Hebrew Bible, his decades in office, and his own experiences with grief. \u201cAs long as the United States stands\u2014and we will stand forever\u2014we will not let you ever be alone,\u201d he said. His remarks also contained a word of caution, based on the United States\u2019 own bitter experiences of going to war in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. \u201cWhile you feel that rage, don\u2019t be consumed by it,\u201d he said.\u00a0 Biden referred back to this warning in an interview with Time magazine published last\u00a0week. \u201cThey\u2019re making that mistake,\u201d he said.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Two former U.S. officials on how Harris can repair Washington\u2019s image in the Middle East.",
                    "post_content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants a war with Iran, as he clearly laid out in his address to the U.S. Congress last month. He returned to Israel emboldened to carry out that goal, seemingly certain of U.S. support\u2014ordering the killing of a top Hamas official on Iranian soil just seven days later. Following Israel\u2019s July 31 assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken quickly asserted that Washington was \u201cnot aware of or involved in\u201d the military operation. Yet given the high level of coordination, particularly intelligence sharing, between the United States and Israel, speculation is rife that the U.S. government was involved or at least condoned the action\u2014as Iranian officials have suggested. This perception is particularly widespread in the Middle East, which is still reeling from the images of U.S. legislators applauding Netanyahu, a man accused of war crimes in Gaza. Merely the perception of U.S. involvement in the assassination has an escalatory effect. This is not in the interests of the United States and threatens the American people. The assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran is not only an attempt to draw Iran and the United States into a war; it is also a sure-fire way to destroy cease-fire negotiations. Haniyeh, as the head of Hamas\u2019s political wing based in Qatar, was one of the leading figures reportedly attempting to get concessions from Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader on the ground in Gaza. Netanyahu rejects a two-state solution and instead seeks a perpetually inflamed Middle East enabling him to finish the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and annexation of the West Bank\u2014and the U.S. government is letting the flames spread. The Biden administration is well aware of the dangers Netanyahu poses. Yet instead of taking a firm line, using diplomatic leverage, such as military assistance, to rein these continuous escalations in, it continues to behave in a fearful and cowardly way\u2014allowing an extremist foreign leader to determine whether the United States gets pulled into yet another disastrous war. Washington is walking into this conflagration with its eyes wide open. As an 18-year veteran of the foreign service and a newcomer to the civil service, we fear that the damage to U.S. national security and diplomacy could be far worse than anything we\u2019ve seen in recent history, including the global war on terrorism and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Experts inside the State Department have been warning the administration for months that unconditional support for Israel was both a morally bankrupt decision and one that directly contradicted U.S. interests in the region. Yet we and our colleagues were sidelined and silenced, and now the United States is on the brink of being drawn into a wider war that does not serve the interests of American people. Since Israel launched its full-scale assault following Hamas\u2019s terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, commentators have asked whether senior U.S. officials have known what is happening in Gaza. The question implies that if they were watching the horrors that flooded social media, they would have to insist that Israel change its behavior or else withdraw U.S. support. Yet, as State Department spokesperson for the Middle East and North Africa region, Hala sent these images and videos to their inboxes every day: The State Department cannot claim it was unaware of what Israel, with U.S. arms, was doing to the civilian population of Gaza. In April, in opposition to the Biden administration\u2019s Gaza policy, Hala resigned from her latest assignment at the U.S. Consulate in Dubai. In March, Annelle resigned from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor in protest of the Biden administration\u2019s unconditional support for Israeli military operations in Gaza. Based on our experiences, the State Department is willfully ignoring the fundamental shifts occurring in the region as a result of unconditional U.S. support for Israel. Far too many people in the U.S. government are enabling a policy they recognize is wrong and illegal. This erroneous and dangerous decision-making is coming from the top and sending the message to all those below to fall in line or risk career consequences. Biden, Blinken, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and White House Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk seem to think the United States can pursue this policy and face few long-term consequences, when in fact irreversible damage has been done and we are now on the brink of an outbreak of violence across the region. This is what Netanyahu seeks, with the support of more American boots on the ground in the Middle East. By continuing to fund, arm, and defend Israel\u2019s attacks on civilians in Gaza and other gross human rights violations, such as the obstruction of food, clean water, and medicine into Gaza, the Biden administration has destroyed U.S. credibility and gravely increased the national security threat to the United States. U.S. complicity is putting a target on the backs of U.S. diplomats and service members for potential retaliation, while it increasingly destabilizes the Middle East and North Africa. Indeed, Arab publics have been protesting for months. July 26 marked the 42nd consecutive week of Moroccans protesting Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza. More than 4,000 miles away, protesters again took to the streets in Muscat, Oman, in support of Palestinians. Jordan has even more intense scenes of mass protests. This is alarming: Morocco and Jordan both have normalized relations with Israel, and until last October, public protest in Oman was exceedingly rare. In October, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was forced to evacuate some personnel due to attacks related to the Gaza conflict. In January, three U.S. service members were killed at Tower 22 in Jordan near the Syrian border in response to U.S. support of Israel. Now, after seven months of relative calm, Iran-backed militias are again targeting U.S. troops. On July 25 and 26, militias launched rockets at U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria. On Aug. 5, rockets injured U.S. service members at a military base in Iraq. U.S. intelligence officials have highlighted such threats for months. FBI Director Christopher Wray expressed concerns in October about possible threats to the United States, saying that groups such as al Qaeda, the Islamic State, and Hezbollah were calling for attacks. In March, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines described a \u201cgenerational impact on terrorism.\u201d As of July, terrorist groups are using Gaza as a recruitment tool, according to the head of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Against this backdrop, State Department officials found it increasingly impossible to try to advance other aspects of U.S. policy, such as advocating for human rights. When meeting with members of civil society from North Africa, for example, department representatives would ask about the ways their governments were cracking down on fundamental freedoms. But these individuals would instead want to talk about Gaza and what the United States was enabling there. State officials could only offer half-hearted assurances that the U.S. government was committed to cease-fire negotiations, a fiction belied by Biden\u2019s dogged refusal to impose consequences on Israel, despite Netanyahu repeatedly rejecting cease-fire proposals. Similarly, when the State Department would ask representatives of Arab governments about political prisoners or restrictions on journalists, they would immediately respond with some version of, \u201cHow can you criticize us? Look at what you are doing in Gaza!\u201d The Biden administration claimed that human rights would be central to its foreign policy; instead, it has destroyed U.S. diplomats\u2019 ability to advocate for human rights. The State Department has acknowledged this privately. A recently leaked internal document demonstrates that senior leaders at the department are aware that U.S. policy is irrevocably damaging U.S. credibility in the Middle East. Yet even though senior State Department officials received daily reports on Gaza and conceded the damage that unconditional U.S. support for Israel was doing to the United States\u2019 standing in the region, their response was not to push back on the policy but rather enable it. For example, in the role of spokesperson, Hala was repeatedly pressured to go out on Arab media and promote the policy, no matter the negative ramifications for the United States. She refused, not only because she felt it was morally wrong and a violation of U.S. and international law but also because it was causing intense backlash against the United States. As the conflict worsened, Hala observed an unprecedented rise in anti-American sentiment throughout the region, something she reported back to Washington with grave alarm. Even so-called liberal Arabs were disgusted by U.S. double standards.\u00a0Yet the same abysmal talking points continued to be generated, and key policymakers refused to change tack. Now, in the aftermath of Israel\u2019s assassination of Haniyeh on Iranian soil and the resulting sabotage of Gaza cease-fire negotiations, everything could get much worse for the region and the United States. A wider war with Hezbollah, the Houthis, and a potential direct confrontation with Iran would be catastrophic, yet it would help Netanyahu\u2019s political survival. Washington can still choose another path forward\u2014one that rejects continuous violence, indiscriminate killings of innocent civilians, and a cycle of revenge. To prevent further escalation and make the prospect for diplomacy and peace a reality, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris needs to seek an end to the carnage and send a clear signal that the United States will not give unconditional support to an Israeli war against Hezbollah and Iran. She must insist on diplomacy and in her current role as vice president pressure the administration to avoid regional war. There may not be anything left of Gaza to save in six months\u2019 time, and that is what Netanyahu is betting on. Harris can correct course by insisting on the application of U.S. laws consistently and fairly when it comes to arms transfers. Applying U.S. laws and regulations (which the administration is currently in violation of) would prompt a conditioning of U.S. military aid to Israel in line with the Leahy laws, the Arms Export Control Act, and the Foreign Assistance Act. Based on its repeated, systematic, documented gross human rights violations and obstruction of U.S. humanitarian assistance, Israel is no longer eligible to receive U.S. security assistance. Harris can make clear that she would use U.S. leverage to pressure Netanyahu to accept the cease-fire agreement. This would also enable Qatar and Egypt to pressure Hamas to make concessions and accept the deal, which it had previously accepted. Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iran have all stated previously that they would not attack if Israel ended the violence and allowed aid into Gaza. By making her stance clear now and taking concrete actions to insist on the application of U.S. laws, Harris would demonstrate her commitment to upholding the view of a majority of Americans who oppose Biden\u2019s unconditional support for Israel and oppose sending U.S. troops to defend Israel from the consequences of its aggression. Her stance could also force Netanyahu to avoid further provocations. Such a move would undermine extremists on all sides. Unfortunately, this cannot wait until November. If she does not act now, she risks U.S. national security and the outbreak of a catastrophic war in the Middle East that the United States would inevitably get dragged into. By taking action now, in line with U.S. laws, Harris would strengthen the Democratic Party\u2019s base and potentially bring back uncommitted and youth voters\u2014without whom she could very well lose the election.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The Uncommitted Movement is putting pressure on Kamala Harris in key swing states, including Michigan.",
                    "post_content": "During the Democratic primary election in Michigan in February, the Uncommitted Movement had a simple message for President Joe Biden: Implement an arms embargo on Israel, or we will not vote for you\u2014potentially causing you to lose a key swing state in November. They were not bluffing; more than 100,000 Michigan Democrats\u2014close to 13 percent of those who voted\u2014chose uncommitted. Israel\u2019s ongoing war in Gaza has hit home with Michigan\u2019s 390,000 Arab Americans, who have continually expressed grievances with Biden and his administration\u2019s supply of unfettered arm shipments to Israel, which they argue is enabling a genocide. Because of those arms transfers, Michigan\u2019s Palestinian and Arab voters view the United States as directly responsible for the death, devastation, and destruction Israel has unleashed in Gaza. This anger has been channeled into political action and mobilization. These voters\u2019 outrage is rightfully directed at Democrats, who claim to be in favor of Palestinian rights but often collaborate with their hawkish Republican counterparts to deny Palestinian freedoms. Several months of dissent from Palestinians and Arab Americans, as well as student protesters and other Democrats who oppose the war, took their toll on Biden\u2019s poll numbers, in July calling into question the president\u2019s chances of winning Michigan. While Biden may no longer be at the top of the Democratic ticket, many of Michigan\u2019s uncommitted Arab American voters are still not backing Harris. Most of them told Foreign Policy that they plan to vote uncommitted if given the option, while smaller swathes of voters have said they may abstain from voting or explore third-party options come November. This sentiment became clear at a Harris campaign event earlier this month, when 15,000 people gathered at a raucous campaign stop at Detroit\u2019s airport. During Harris\u2019s speech, two protesters chanted: \u201cKamala, Kamala, you can\u2019t hide! We won\u2019t vote for genocide!\u201d The vice president lost her patience and admonished them: \u201cYou know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise, I\u2019m speaking.\u201d One of the protesters Harris singled out was Salma Hamamy, a Palestinian American woman who is the president of Students Allied for Freedom and Equality and head of the TAHRIR Coalition at the University of Michigan. According to Hamamy, \u201cThis could have been a moment for her to express support with Palestinians and say \u2018OK, I will take action and make changes,\u2019\u201d Hamamy said to FP. \u201cInstead, Harris belittled us and used her event as a platform to say, \u2018You are stuck with me and there is nothing we will do to help Palestinians.\u2019\u201d Despite polls currently projecting Harris to win Michigan, the vice president should not get comfortable too quickly. Her lead is still slim, and she would be wise not to underestimate Arab American voters. Layla Elabed, co-chair of the Uncommitted National Movement, reinforced this notion at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday. \u201c[Harris] is at risk of losing key swing states,\u201d Elabed said at a press conference at the convention. \u201cRight now, the majority of Michigan voters \u2026 cannot put their support behind Vice President Harris,\u201d Elabed continued. \u201cWhat we need right now is a policy change.\u201d At the same rally where Hamamy confronted Harris, Elabed and Abbas Alawieh, one of the founders of the Uncommitted Movement, were able to secure a brief meeting with the vice president. There, Harris indicated Democrats should be open to having a conversation about imposing an arms embargo on Israel, they said. Elabed reportedly told Harris, \u201cMichigan voters want to support you, but we need a policy that will save lives in Gaza right now.\u201d The contrasting approaches\u2014disruptive protests or direct engagement with Democratic Party leaders\u2014raises the question of which strategy is more effective? For most of Michigan\u2019s Arab American voters, voting uncommitted remains the objective. Some in the Arab American community are voting uncommitted as an opportunity to express their fear Harris will be no different than Biden on the issue of supplying military aid to Israel. Of the 70 prospective Arab American voters that spoke with Foreign Policy, 65 referenced Harris\u2019s commitments to Israel as Biden\u2019s running mate four years ago. During that campaign, Harris stated that the Biden administration would continue providing Israel with unconditioned military assistance. As many Arab Americans see it, Harris\u2019s reported sympathy for Palestinians in Gaza is not translating into real policy changes on Israel. When meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month, Harris spoke sternly and highlighted Palestinian suffering in Gaza. Harris also expressed support for ending the war. However, for Palestinian Americans such as Ameen, who wished to have his last name withheld, Harris\u2019s failure to successfully push for change makes her an extension of Biden\u2019s policies and directly complicit in Palestinian suffering. \u201cWe do not want just kind words, because Palestinian life is not something to take lightly,\u201d he said. Many uncommitted voters think Harris\u2019s support for military assistance to Israel will not change unless she is forced to do so by uncommitted voters applying political pressure. The hope is that, in the long term, such pressure will break the status quo of Washington\u2019s unwavering support of Israel and swing the pendulum in favor of the Palestinians. Already, due to the movement\u2019s efforts, the convention in Chicago held a first-ever panel on Palestinian human rights. Another factor motivating voters to oppose Harris is the belief that the uncommitted movement can be leveraged to their advantage by demonstrating their frustrations over having to choose between the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d (Harris and former President Donald Trump), local Lebanese American Samaria Bazzi said. Bazzi said she may vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein due to Stein\u2019s stance on Palestine. (A few weeks ago, Stein appeared to be a hot commodity in Michigan. An Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee poll found in late July that 45 percent of Arab Americans nationwide would vote for Stein. However, most voters who spoke with Foreign Policy expressed little support for Stein, instead indicating they would rather vote uncommitted or not vote at all in November.) Farah Khan, a spokeswoman with the Abandon Harris movement (formerly Abandon Biden), told Foreign Policy that by voting uncommitted or for a third party, voters \u201ccan break the mentality of voting for the lesser of two evils. We need good candidates; we need to elect officials who are worthy of our vote.\u201d Khan believes the Uncommitted Movement has empowered the Arab American community in Michigan with political agency and power that it never had before. \u201cWe have become a credible threat politically,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWe do not have the power to put someone in the office, but we have the power to take someone out of the office. [We] did not even know we could do this. We are now aware of this power [and] we should use it.\u201d There is a small segment of the community that sees influencing the party from within, rather than protesting from outside the tent, as the more effective tactic. \u201cThe Palestinian rights movement needs to increase its influence and power in the Democratic Party,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, director of communication for Justice Democrats and one of the founders of the Uncommitted Movement, in an interview with +972 Magazine. \u201cProgressive, young, and Arab and Muslim Democrats have to provide some sort of infrastructure that can match the level of influence that pro-Israel organizations have,\u201d Shahid added. To some extent, Shahid sees signs of success, from Harris\u2019s Selma, Alabama, speech hinting at a more progressive stance on Palestinian issues to the work of organizers. Shahid noted he was \u201cskeptical of the Democratic Party and the White House\u2019s appetite to respond to Muslim American and Arab American organizing \u2026.\u00a0But I was pleasantly surprised.\u201d Other uncommitted voters insist the movement should be leveraged in a manner that gets other Americans on board. According to Matthew Petti, a journalist at Reason magazine who is not part of the movement, those who chose to work with Democratic leaders to induce change made a smart choice, allowing the movement to be a part of the party and shielding it from accusations that it is helping Trump win. \u201cOne of the charges thrown at left-wing Palestinians and their allies is that they\u2019re willing to throw the election to Republicans out of vindictiveness,\u201d Petti said. \u201cRallying behind the Uncommitted Movement was a clever response, sending the message that they are a part of the Democratic coalition and willing to work with the party but need a seat at the table in return.\u201d Regardless of whether the Uncommitted Movement ultimately chooses public protest or internal pressure on Democrats, Harris\u2019s resort to threatening pro-Palestine protesters with a potential second Trump presidency earlier this month is not likely to win her votes. That\u2019s because there is a widespread sentiment among uncommitted voters that has gone unnoticed by national media pundits: On the issue of Palestine, not only do Arab Americans in Michigan not see a difference between Harris and Biden, they also do not see how Harris differs significantly from Trump. While Palestinians and other Arab Americans are aware that Trump\u2019s presidency could be more dangerous for them given that he has promised to reinstate his infamous Muslim ban and bar refugees from Gaza from the United States, they are not willing to give Democrats a pass. Those interviewed by FP noted that both Harris and Biden enforced Trump\u2019s draconian anti-Palestinian policies once he left office. Trump\u2019s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo implemented the notorious \u201cPompeo Doctrine,\u201d which asserted that settlements were no longer illegal, a departure from longstanding U.S. policy\u2014going so far as to mandate the labeling of goods produced in settlements on occupied Palestinian territory as \u201cMade in Israel.\u201d During his tenure, the U.S. government moved the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem, and stripped funding from UNRWA, the U.N. agency focused on Palestinian refugees. As uncommitted voters are quick to point out, nearly six years have passed and many of these policies are still being actively enforced by the Biden administration today. The Palestinian consulate has not been reopened in Jerusalem, the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s office in Washington is still shuttered, and the UNRWA still does not have proper U.S. funding. As Biden\u2019s vice president, Harris has not spoken out against these policies nor indicated whether she would reverse them if she were elected. By continuing to apply pressure on Harris, uncommitted voters feel they might be able to shift her stance. \u201cYou want to try to and like Harris, even support her, but her and Biden continuing many of Trump\u2019s policies is a major red flag,\u201d said Saba Saed, a fourth-year student at Michigan State University and president of the university\u2019s Cultural Society. \u201cIf Harris will not restore funding to UNRWA and end the Trump era policies, then good luck come November.\u201d A Palestinian man from Dearborn, Michigan, whose family\u2019s roots are in the West Bank city of Ramallah, but who has also lost family members in Gaza, gave a morbid analogy to reinforce how Arab voters see Harris and Trump. \u201cA famous Palestinian poet once said, \u2018A killer can strangle you with a silk scarf or can smash your head in with an axe,\u2019\u201d said the man, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid future difficulties traveling to the region. \u201cKamala is the one with the silk scarf. She may not deport me, but she will still send bombs to Israel to kill my people in Gaza. Trump has the axe. He will both deport me and my people, then give Israel the bombs to kill us both. But what\u2019s the difference between them? \u201cEither way, we are dead.\u201d",

                    "post_content": "Amid the recurring thrust and parry of attacks between Israel and Iran in recent months, a parallel track of cease-fire talks has also followed a pattern: a flurry of diplomacy followed by a familiar sense of resignation and failure. Amid these disappointments, the broader question of unified Palestinian governance\u2014let alone a two-state solution\u2014seems forgotten, like an old fever dream.\u00a0 Tell that to Salam Fayyad. The former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority once presided over a period of state-building and governance that raised hopes for the future. Today, as a professor at Princeton University, Fayyad\u2019s name is often invoked as a possible leader for a hypothetical \u201cday after\u201d\u2014a period following a cease-fire when the Palestinian territories can renounce violence and rebuild.\u00a0 I spoke with Fayyad on FP Live. Subscribers can watch the full discussion on the video box atop this page. What follows is a condensed and edited transcript.\u00a0 Ravi Agrawal: It\u2019s been more than 10 months since Oct. 7, and it seems to me that one reason things have become so protracted is that there\u2019s no commonly accepted definition of \u201cvictory.\u201d Israel defines victory as completely degrading Hamas. You have written that that is an impossible goal, and that, in fact, Hamas can claim victory simply for surviving for so long. As an outsider observing this, it feels there\u2019s no end in sight. Salam Fayyad: Sadly, it appears that way. From the very beginning, it appeared to me that this was going to be a war to the end, relative to the objectives declared by the government of Israel. First things first, let\u2019s have this war of aggression come to an end. That\u2019s what is important. Granted, I was among the first to suggest that we should think about the \u201cday after\u201d the war, which should have come 10 months ago, in my humble opinion. But that didn\u2019t happen. And to the best of my knowledge, so far, there is no consensus on how to manage that when the day actually arrives. But when it does, not a day too soon that will be. What\u2019s really important is to bring this round of diplomacy to fruition. We are at the point where the United States must assert more presence and try to persuade [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu to stop moving the goalposts on this operation. This most recent round of diplomacy, which took the form of multiple meetings and discussions and negotiations, started out with President [Joe] Biden in May announcing a plan for bringing the war to an end. Then at the time, he said that was identical to what Prime Minister Netanyahu himself suggested as a way to actually begin to end the war. But since then, Israel continued to change the parameters of a deal in a way that has made getting to an agreement an elusive task at best. And here we are, months after Biden made that announcement and after the U.N. enshrined that declaration into a Security Council resolution, still at the point where we are not able to see an end to the war. RA: Do you see the United States as a fair arbiter? SF: I can tell you that the United States has to do more. My sense is the United States wishes for this war to end. With the problem having become an internal issue for the United States in many important ways, I can see the United States believes this war needs to come to an end. But at the same time, I just don\u2019t see it doing enough. It\u2019s time for the United States to put its foot down and stop saying after each round of diplomacy [that] Israel agreed and now it\u2019s really up to Hamas. How many times have we heard this? Netanyahu keeps on changing the parameters, and then he announces he agreed to the plan as amended by him. And then you have the United States saying, \u201cIsrael agrees with the plan, and it\u2019s up to Hamas.\u201d That game has to stop. It\u2019s about time to call Netanyahu out on this. To answer your question directly, my sense is that it\u2019s time for the United States, if it really means what it says, to bring the war to an end. And this is well within what it can do. RA: And you think it has the leverage to do that? SF: Israel has been on a path that basically says \u201cmy way or the highway.\u201d It\u2019s a matter that has caused a lot of political commotion around the world. To the extent that it really matters, and I think it should, it\u2019s time for the international community\u2014and the United States, in particular\u2014to actually put its foot down and say, enough already. The United States does have that capacity. I have dealt with the U.S. administrations many years, and they say all the time that it\u2019s up to the parties. We cannot really get them to do what they do not want to do or they\u2019re not willing to do. But look, the issue has become a domestic policy issue for the United States, not to mention in its own standing in the region and internationally. Either it is a superpower\u2014and it is\u2014or are we supposed to believe that with all its might and influence and instruments at its disposal, it is unable to convince a country that ultimately depends on the United States for its ability to continue to prosecute the war, to stop the war, or to accept conditions that the U.S. administration itself thought were reasonable? That\u2019s a legitimate question. RA: I want to jump to what is known as \u201cthe day after.\u201d This assumes that we have a cease-fire somehow, even though it seems very unlikely right now. You laid out some proposals for what that day after could look like. The first step you\u2019ve said is that one has to include Hamas in the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization]. Can you explain how that works? Because it\u2019s a huge stumbling block for everyone to accept. SF: Well, it has not been tried actually. If by everyone you mean Israel, Israel\u2019s not going to accept anything. Israel, from the very beginning, said \u201cno\u201d to a Palestinian Authority presence in Gaza. And it continues to say that. That\u2019s Israel\u2019s position. The international community is another method. Where the international community, including the United States, would eventually stand on the question of including Hamas in Palestinian policy is a proposition that is yet to be tested. And part of the reason, if not the main reason why that has not happened yet, is because we Palestinians have not moved to make it happen. Going back to late October of last year, a couple of weeks after Oct. 7, I proposed including Hamas in the PLO, which is the umbrella organization for all Palestinian factions. And it is referred to as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and it\u2019s accepted as such\u2014broadly, internationally, regionally. But it\u2019s an entity that has lost much of its standing over time, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the failure of the paradigm on which it stood upon the signing of the Oslo Accords, when it signaled its willingness to accept a state on the territories as [they were] occupied in 1967 as a solution to the conflict. But since the signing of the Oslo Accords, there has been a fracture in that Palestinian body politic that became deeper and deeper over time. In any event, the bet that the PLO made on Oslo did not actually pan out, as everybody knows very well. This is a failure of doctrine, if you will. So it\u2019s not surprising for its standing to diminish with the Palestinian public, not only in Palestine but throughout the world. And that vacuum was going to be filled by ideologies that were competing with the PLO\u2019s platform to begin with. RA: How do you square that circle, given that even the United States has said it would reject any long-term governance of Gaza by Hamas? SF: That\u2019s part of the solution of getting Palestinian governance in postwar Gaza. Part of the solution is to bring everyone around the table\u2014that\u2019s the PLO\u2014and that must include factions that are opposed to the process, because continuing to exclude them would continue to make the PLO irrelevant in the minds of the Palestinian people. It\u2019s supposed to represent all of us. It\u2019s supposed to be our sole legitimate representative. So there is a basic, fundamental, flagrant contradiction of terms here. How can an entity be the sole legitimate representative of the people when the majority of Palestinians do not support this platform? Now, if you bring everybody around the table, and the important task of that forum is to consent to a government that is not of the factions to govern in Gaza and the West Bank. That\u2019s the major advance. And I submit it\u2019s a necessary step in order to restore Palestinian governance in Gaza. So Hamas is not going to be a part of the government. And, by the way, they signaled their willingness to accept that formulation, when all of the factions went to Beijing for talks and signed a [unity] document. All Palestinian factions, including Fatah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and everyone else, agree with a formulation where the PLO, under a temporary leadership framework, would convene with the key objective being a unified leadership. The most immediate task is the formation of a non-factional government to assume responsibility for the needs of all people in Gaza and in the West Bank. The goal was not for Hamas to govern Gaza, but for Hamas to be included in a leadership framework within the PLO. A key task of that forum would be to agree to a Palestinian Authority government that\u2019s able to deal with the needs of the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. But the first step is a process of political accommodation that can bring about the unity that is necessary for this proposed formula to actually be implemented. I truly believe if all Palestinians band together, the international community, including the United States, will find a way to deal with this. If you want to connect all of this to the idea of restoring a pathway to Palestinian statehood on the territory Israel occupied in 1967, part of what needs to be firmly in place would be a commitment to nonviolence. The question I ask everyone: How credible can a Palestinian commitment to nonviolence be if Hamas and those with the guns are not a part of that agreement? The PLO, as it stands now, does not include those forces, the armed factions. Unless they are part of that consensus, no commitment to nonviolence can or should be viewed as credible. And I believe, personally, that is an essential ingredient for moving forward. RA: Aaron David Miller, as you know, is a longtime Mideast negotiator representing several U.S. administrations. And he writes in to say that the two-state solution is \u201can idea for a galaxy far, far away,\u201d in part because of a crisis of leadership. And he\u2019s wondering, \u201cWhere is the leader who has legitimacy to create a unified Palestinian national movement with one gun, one authority, and one negotiating position?\u201d SF: The two-state solution has been pronounced dead or near death since the turn of the century. I don\u2019t know if one should be so definitive about the fate of a solution between us, Palestinians and Israelis. Now, a lot has to change, for sure, in order for that to become reality. I said recently, particularly in connection with Saudi normalization, that effort needs to be inclusive of a Palestinian component.\u00a0 RA: But to get to the second part of Aaron\u2019s question, where is the leader who has legitimacy to speak for the Palestinian people? SF: I think Aaron would agree with me that for much too long the search has been on for a leader rather than a process that could produce leadership. We have not had elections since 2005 and 2006. That\u2019s a long period of time. It\u2019s difficult to see how elections can have their place under current conditions. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying what we really need is a multiyear transitional period in which there is commitment to nonviolence. A key component of that is recognition of the Palestinian people\u2019s right to a sovereign state on the territory Israel occupied in 1967. That is different from recognizing the state of Palestine, which some 150 countries already do. I\u2019m talking about recognition of our right to statehood. I think any process, particularly given the failures of the past more than three decades, that begins without a clear and unequivocal statement of recognition of our natural rights as a people, including our right to a sovereign state on the territory Israel occupied in 1967, is not going to yield better results than what we have experienced in the past. Palestinian leadership engaged in a highly transactional process under Oslo. Aaron David Miller knows that very well. They did so in the hope and expectation that recognizing the right of the state of Israel to exist in peace and security was going to deliver a [Palestinian] state in another five years. When that did not happen, and it eluded those who tried to make that happen, one administration after another as well as Palestinians, Arabs, Israelis, I think it\u2019s time to ask, \u201cAre we on the right path?\u201d The answer is no. All you have to do is listen to the rhetoric coming out from the government of Israel, from Mr. Netanyahu himself. He actually ran for prime minister for the first time in 1996 on a platform that was opposed to Oslo. Every election he used to say: \u201cNot on my watch. There\u2019s not going to ever be sovereignty anywhere between the River Jordan and Mediterranean except for Israel.\u201d So how can you really take a process seriously if it begins with this denial of our most basic of rights? RA: Are you, in effect, saying that none of the things you\u2019re proposing is possible as long as Netanyahu is prime minister? SF: I submit to you, if a piece of paper is submitted to the government of Israel to sign that says, we agree with the idea of a reversible and revocable path to a Palestinian state, they would not sign it because they are opposed to the idea of Palestinian statehood. So, therefore, I proposed a workaround to this issue should there be a next phase. You cannot condition movement on Palestinian statehood, which is essential, on Israel joining the party on the outset. It\u2019s not going to. And to continue to hold that process hostage would continue to leave the region in the sorry state it has been in for many decades. Even the war in Gaza right now is a manifestation of that. So my proposal is to begin concretely with an unequivocally clear statement recognizing our natural rights as a people, including the right to self-determination, including the right to a sovereign state on the territory Israel occupied in 1967. Enshrine that in the Security Council resolution. Israel does not have to agree to that. That\u2019s the international community, that\u2019s the highest level of international decision-making. Have that right enshrined in international law and then work on getting this transition. When things begin to calm down, we have space in which to actually project the reality of our state on the ground. If we continue to wait for Mr. Netanyahu or anyone else governing Israel to say yes, they\u2019re not about to give it up. That\u2019s fundamentally what this is about. They\u2019re not accepting of the principle of Palestinian statehood. I understand the importance of security, understand the need for the political process to be underpinned by firm commitment to nonviolence, and for that to be subject to all kinds of monitoring. I\u2019m all for that, as a matter of fact. But for that process to really mean something, and for it to really begin to give the Palestinian people a sense of hope about a better tomorrow, that means being able to live as free people, with dignity. I think that\u2019s when you begin to see a little bit of balance restored. But to continue to say you need to somehow audition for your right to something no other people in the world is actually expected to live up to? The days for this are done. It is no longer acceptable for the needs of one party, or the narrative of one party, to be prioritized over the needs of the other. RA: As you talk about a possible transitional government, has anyone approached you to be a part of such a government? SF: No, there has not been anything like that. There have been reports of my involvement in postwar Gaza. These are conversations about me, but none of them has been with me. RA: What is your sense of how a President [Donald] Trump or President [Kamala] Harris would move the needle on what seems to be an intractable problem? SF: I\u2019m not very invested in thinking about elections in terms of how they bear on our situation because we\u2019ve been through many administrations before. I\u2019m interested in a day when we Palestinians can actually go to the polls and elect our own leadership. I\u2019m more interested in what we do for ourselves to most doggedly invest in projecting the reality of our statehood on the ground in the face of occupation, on the way to ending it. But changes have taken place recently, especially amongst younger people. Certainly, the war in Gaza has become a kitchen-table conversation in many homes in the United States. The fact that it got the mention it did at the Democratic National Convention the other day, Israel\u2019s security needs and all of that was recognized, if you listen carefully you also must have sensed the great enthusiasm with which reference to Palestinian needs was received by delegates. That\u2019s significant. But let\u2019s just begin with the most basic thing of all. If this is about two states, one of them has been in existence for more than three-quarters of a century. So the process has to be redefined in terms of the outcome that should matter the most, the emergence of that other state.",

                    "post_content": "Gaza\u2019s recently\u00a0confirmed polio outbreak\u00a0is a barometer of the catastrophic public health conditions created by the Israeli military\u2014but what many Israelis don\u2019t realize is that the systematic assault by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on health care and public health infrastructure in Gaza has now come back to haunt them. It has placed hundreds of thousands of Israelis at risk of contracting an ancient virus that strikes suddenly, paralyzing limbs and even sometimes lungs. It is so contagious that each afflicted person means several hundred others are simultaneously and invisibly spreading this incurable disease. Although polio has been eradicated in most developed nations, Israel has particular reason to be concerned about the disease. The country has at least\u00a0175,000\u00a0vulnerable children\u2014the offspring of the ultra-Orthodox, or haredim, who are notorious for their opposition to vaccinations. Because the haredim comprise 17 percent of Israel\u2019s Jews and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs their support to remain in power, his government has exempted hundreds of thousands of haredim from Israel\u2019s immunization program against polio as well as measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and HPV, influenza, and COVID-19\u2014despite the threat to domestic and global health from these vaccine-preventable diseases. That decision, coupled with his stubborn refusal to negotiate a permanent cease-fire in Gaza, has now put Israel\u2019s unvaccinated at risk of contracting polio. Thursday\u2019s announcement that Israel will allow limited combat pauses in Gaza for vaccination at designated sites is insufficient to prevent ongoing spread of the deadly virus because parents will be required to bring their children to those sites while combat elsewhere in Gaza rages; most parents simply won\u2019t risk it. That fighting also makes impossible the kind of active outreach by healthcare workers among Gaza\u2019s displaced population needed to obtain the near-universal vaccination required to stop the outbreak. Shortly after polio was detected in Gaza\u2019s sewers, the Israeli government began offering vaccinations to troops returning from Gaza. These optional shots protect soldiers from contracting polio but not from taking it back to Israel, effectively turning them into dangerous vectors of this incredibly contagious disease. Most Israelis have largely tuned out the suffering of Palestinians caused by\u00a0Israeli bombs, but the potential for the spread of a deadly disease to their own children could finally get their attention. The risk of another polio outbreak in Israel also provides a strong incentive for Netanyahu to agree to regular prolonged humanitarian pauses to allow systematic mass vaccination to proceed in Gaza, where efforts have lapsed during the war. That could also lay the groundwork for a lasting cease-fire. More than 10 months of Israeli bombardment has destroyed Gaza\u2019s water sources and sanitation systems and forced almost 2 million people from their homes into crowded camps. The humanitarian blockade imposed by Israeli authorities has withheld essential nutrition, critical medicines, and lifesaving public health technology. Meanwhile, in more than\u00a01,000 attacks on health care facilities, equipment, and staff, the Israeli military has\u00a0killed or detained more than 800 medical personnel. To Palestinians, the international community\u2019s laser-like focus on polio after a single unimmunized infant was partially paralyzed may seem perverse. After all, Palestinian children are far more likely to be crippled by Israeli bombs than paralyzed by a virus not seen in Gaza since 1985. Although it is no longer the world\u2019s most feared disease, polio still cripples hundreds of children every year and suffocates some to death. It now threatens Israeli children, too. And if\u00a0polio\u00a0is what it takes to humanize the horrors facing civilians\u00a0in Gaza, the international community must seize the opportunity. In July, analysis of environmental samples in Gaza detected type 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus\u00a0(cVDPV2), suggesting months of circulation and similarities with a strain found in sewers in Egypt, the country from which most aid trucks for Gaza arrive. A slightly different \u00a0strain found in Jerusalem\u2019s sewers was linked to outbreaks in 2022 and 2023. A vaccine-derived poliovirus comes from the weakened live poliovirus contained in oral vaccines. In a fully vaccinated population it is not a threat, but if this weakened form of the virus has the opportunity to circulate among those lacking herd immunity or those compromised by prolonged starvation and disease, it can mutate into a form of poliovirus that causes illness and paralysis. Despite a degraded public health system, lack of safe drinking water, and constant cross-border movement, Gaza\u2019s health authorities protected the population for decades by maintaining very high vaccination rates. They used intramuscular polio vaccines to protect individuals, in addition to oral polio vaccines, which create protection against transmission, to protect the whole population. The associated herd immunity protected Gaza\u2019s immunosuppressed and partially immunized infants. War typically disrupts routine immunization services, regardless of the location. But in Gaza, polio immunization rates have dropped dramatically, from 99 percent in 2022 to about 86 percent by mid-2024\u2014below the level required for herd immunity. The way that Israel has waged the current war has exacerbated the situation. Chlorine is the only reliable way to disinfect contaminated water\u2014as polio is relatively resistant to heat and acid. Yet since Oct. 7, Israeli troops have\u00a0withheld chlorine from Gaza and destroyed all\u00a0wastewater treatment plants. Since May,\u00a0nearly 800,000 people have been displaced to Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah, where\u00a0samples were collected on June 23.\u00a0The squalid living conditions, lack of safe water, starvation, and attacks targeting health care facilities make routine vaccination impossible. This is the ideal environment for the oral vaccine to mutate into vaccine-derived polio and emerge as a virulent stealth virus. Movement makes contact tracing challenging and turbocharges transmission of the virus. Without a rapid test for polio, detection depends on clinical diagnosis.\u00a0Fewer than 1 percent\u00a0of polio cases result in paralysis, and most symptoms\u2014fever, fatigue, headache, and vomiting\u2014are common to hundreds of illnesses. As a clinician familiar with polio and war zones, I know firsthand how hard polio is to diagnose. Laboratory confirmation relies on collecting two stool samples within two days of infection from kids who cannot always defecate when doctors ask. Gaza\u2019s physicians are experts in war trauma, but few of them have ever seen polio. In these circumstances, a mass vaccination campaign with oral polio vaccines is vital to stop the spread. The World Health Organization (WHO) has promised\u00a01.6 million vaccine doses, and some have arrived , but that is only the beginning. Aid organizations must now organize the vaccination campaign while war rages. To remain viable, vaccines must be stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, yet because Israel withholds fuel for refrigeration, the WHO has to deliver cold-chain equipment. Summer heat, persistent insecurity, and Israel\u2019s\u00a0ongoing obstruction of aid\u00a0compound the challenges. The most successful polio campaigns rely on multiple door-to-door visits, but since more than 80 percent of Gaza\u2019s buildings have been destroyed, parents will have to bring children to fixed posts; the ongoing threat of bombing and general insecurity make it hard to achieve high coverage in such circumstances, despite Israel\u2019s agreement to limited combat pauses in certain areas. As if to underscore the point, Israel\u2019s vow to allow limited pauses for vaccination came a day after the World Food Program suspended its own food delivery because one of its vehicles was fired upon a few meters from an Israeli army checkpoint. Prolonged humanitarian pauses permitting multiple vaccination campaigns could curtail and control this dreaded virus in Gaza and, by extension, for over 100,000 of Israel\u2019s unvaccinated and under-vaccinated citizens. Israel, like all countries, cares about polio and other contagious threats.After Israel\u2019s 1988 outbreak, the government copied Gaza\u2019s immunization program: High uptake among the non-haredi population successfully eliminated wild polio. For the next 33 years, the Israeli government protected its unvaccinated population through well-developed public health services and regular surveillance. But for the fast-growing unvaccinated ultra-Orthodox population, highly concentrated chlorinated water is no longer enough. In\u00a0February 2022,\u00a0an outbreak in an ultra-Orthodox district of Jerusalem crippled an unvaccinated 3-year-old girl. In 2022,\u00a0polio reported from dozens of samples in Jerusalem sewers was linked to the May 2022 outbreak in\u00a0New York\u00a0and another in northern Israel in February 2023. Because the only way to protect the unvaccinated ultra-Orthodox in Israel is to control polio in Gaza\u2014and because Netanyahu depends on ultra-Orthodox parties\u2019 support to stay in power\u2014the Israeli government now has an incentive to agree to the prolonged humanitarian pauses needed for a successful vaccination campaign. Such calls may be especially attractive to Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community, who are hardly members of Israel\u2019s peace camp. The determination of public health organizations to end one of the world\u2019s most dreaded diseases and a diplomatic effort to enforce prolonged pauses for polio vaccinations could help change the narrative in Gaza from indifference and devastation to one of solidarity and hope in the face of a deadly disease.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The Sunbirds\u2019 story began with tragedy but has evolved into one of resilience.",
                    "post_content": "CAIRO\u2014I first met members of the Gaza Sunbirds in April, just days after they managed to escape the war in the Gaza Strip. For co-founder Alaa al-Daly, 26, it was his first time leaving the besieged territory. The Sunbirds, a Gaza-based para-cycling organization started by Daly and Karim Ali, trains and supports athletes with disabilities amid conflict. After fleeing a devastating war, the Sunbirds did not rest. Instead, they set their sights on qualifying for the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, which began on Aug. 28, in the hopes of raising awareness about the Palestinian cause. Although the team recently learned that its quest was unsuccessful, it still aims to inspire future Palestinian athletes. \u201cI left my family behind under bombs in a genocide just to compete. Now, I have to wait four years,\u201d Daly said, vowing to push forward and prepare for the next Paralympics, which will be held in Los Angeles in 2028. The first step on that path is the International Cycling Union\u2019s Road and Paracycling Road World Championships in Zurich, where Daly will compete next month. This event is historic\u2014marking the first time that the cycling and para-cycling championships will be held together. \u201cThis presents a unique opportunity for para-cycling to receive the same level of media attention as regular cycling,\u201d Ali said. The Sunbirds\u2019 story began with tragedy but has evolved into one of remarkable resilience. Until 2018, Daly worked in construction and was a member of the Palestinian national cycling team. That year, Israeli forces shot him in the leg during the Great March of Return, a series of protests along the Gaza-Israel border in which thousands of Palestinians demanded the right to return to the ancestral lands from which they were displaced in 1948, when the state of Israel was founded. Throughout the demonstrations, which lasted from March 2018 to December 2019, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) deployed live ammunition, tear gas, and rubber bullets against protesters, leading to numerous casualties. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, almost 8,000 Palestinians were shot with live ammunition during this period; the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees reports that at least 195 individuals were killed. \u201cI went peacefully with my bicycle and national team jersey. I\u2019m sure they shot me in the leg on purpose because they saw I was an athlete on my bike,\u201d Daly said. \u201cIt was extremely tough for me, losing a leg, but they only made me more persistent.\u201d Shortages of essential medical supplies in Gaza mean that care is often compromised. This has created a so-called amputee crisis. During the Great March of Return, the U.N. recorded 156 amputations due to IDF fire; 60 percent of these cases required secondary amputations due to infections. Daly\u2019s injury led doctors to amputate his right leg. Although he struggled to find new employment due to his disability, he was determined to stay connected to cycling. With support from his family and friends, Daly relearned how to ride a normal bicycle. Together with Ali, a Palestinian Cypriot who lives in London and met Daly virtually, Daly created the Gaza Sunbirds. For five years, the two managed the organization remotely, with Ali handling operations from London and Daly coordinating from Gaza. Their first in-person meeting took place in April, following Daly\u2019s departure from Gaza. The Sunbirds are registered as a community interest company in the United Kingdom. Today, the team includes around 50 male athletes with disabilities who cycle. Members range from 10 to 50 years old. A scene from Sunbirds: Road to a Paralympic Dream by Italian director Flavia Cappellini shows Daly (left) and Ali during training in Al-Ain Al-Sokhna, Egypt, in April. Video by Jonathan Rashad Even before the start of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza last year, the Sunbirds faced immense challenges training in the enclave. Since 2007, Israel has held Gaza under a blockade\u2014controlling the densely populated territory\u2019s airspace, land borders, and coastal waters. The restrictions on movement have decimated Gaza\u2019s economy, creating dire humanitarian conditions. Residents also face psychological trauma due to conflict. A 2020 study found that more than half of Gaza\u2019s children were suffering from PTSD, underscoring the profound psychological toll of the ongoing conflict. The medical journal Lancet warns that the war has only deepened the mental health crisis affecting its roughly 2.1 million residents. \u201cThe occupation\u2019s challenges make life impossible, affecting mental health,\u201d Ali said. The Sunbirds became an outlet for many amputees, but the group has always had limited access to proper cycling equipment and training facilities. Ali noted that simply riding bikes was a logistical nightmare under siege, with constant monitoring by drones and planes, travel restrictions, and regulations affecting the materials that can enter Gaza. Yet the team continued to train, hoping to represent Palestinians on the international stage. Daly, who was born in 1997, grew up in Gaza and has witnessed eight major Palestinian-Israeli conflicts\u2014starting with the Second Intifada and ending with the ongoing war. The new round of hostilities erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, following a Hamas-led assault that killed 1,200 Israelis and saw 251 people taken hostage. At least 40,600 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Gaza in the Israeli military onslaught that has followed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The current war plunged the Gaza Sunbirds into chaos, displacing the team and obliterating its training facilities. Its practice space, once a haven, was reduced to debris by Israeli strikes. Hungry and thirsty, team members rescued friends from rubble and dodged airstrikes, witnessing buildings collapse around them. \u201cLiving in Gaza, you grow numb anticipating death at any moment,\u201d Daly said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget watching a woman desperately trying to wake her dead children, bombed while she fetched food. \u2026 This is the reality of our lives right now.\u201d The Sunbirds were undeterred, turning tragedy into action. Thanks to donations, the team said it has provided aid and food packages to more than 90,000 Palestinians in Gaza during the war, despite themselves enduring dire circumstances. Daly distributed food while drones and planes struck throughout the strip, cycling with one leg through rubble, damaged streets, and dust. \u201cWe used to go out\u2014with our disabilities\u2014delivering food aid packages all over Gaza amid bombings just meters away. Sometimes we used bikes. Sometimes horse-drawn carriages. The goal was to feed the people of Gaza,\u201d Daly recalled. More than 80 percent of Gaza\u2019s roughly 2.1 million residents are internally displaced. Northern Gaza is facing a full-blown famine, according to the U.N. Civilians are struggling to find food, and at least 27 children had died from starvation as of April 2, nongovernmental organization Save the Children reported. \u201cDue to the lack of food, some [Sunbirds] team members in Gaza were so hungry they had to eat livestock feed just to survive,\u201d Daly said. Last year, South Africa brought a case at the International Court of Justice, alleging that Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. In January, the court concluded it had jurisdiction over the matter and acknowledged the risk of \u201cirreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people\u201d if Israel did not change course. In April, three Sunbirds managed to escape to Egypt: Daly; Mohamed Asfour, 24; and Waheed Rabah, 48. All lost their legs in the 2018 Great March of Return. Like thousands of Gazans, the trio navigated grueling border logistics to leave the enclave. Traveling with their coach and two officials from the Palestinian national cycling federation, their departure was delayed as they awaited approval at the Rafah border crossing, which was then controlled by Palestinian authorities. (Israel took control of the crossing two weeks later.) Now safe, Daly fears tragic news about his family back home whenever he leaves his phone unattended. \u201cWe\u2019re still living through the war even though we\u2019re outside of Gaza. Our wives and children are still there, subjected to genocide. That is also affecting my focus in the training,\u201d he said. After arriving in Egypt, Dali, Asfour, and Rabah had less than two weeks to train for one of the qualifiers for the Paris Paralympics, which was held in Ostend, Belgium, in May. The team faced significant visa challenges in getting to Europe. None of them qualified for the Games, likely due in part to insufficient training during the war. With their qualification hopes dashed, Asfour and Rabah applied for asylum in Belgium, jeopardizing their futures with the Palestinian national team. Daly then eyed a solo invitation to the Paralympics\u2014a possibility for athletes from countries facing significant crises. He applied to an International Paralympic Committee (IPC) body known as the Bipartite Commission. \u201cCountries can apply for individual para-cyclists to get this invitation, for extenuating circumstances that might have prevented them from regularly qualifying for the Games,\u201d Ali said. Daly sent his application to the Bipartite Commission in July. Both Daly and Ali expected the application to prioritize athletes from conflict zones, but in the end, the IPC declined to invite Daly to Paris. \u201cIt was heartbreaking for me not to make it the Paralympics,\u201d Daly said. Fadi Deeb, a shot-putter, will be the sole Palestinian Paralympian in Paris. The Sunbirds say they take pride in Deeb raising the Palestinian flag on the global stage, acknowledging the immense burden that he carries as their people\u2019s lone representative. \u201cI am very happy that there will be another athlete from Palestine taking part in these games,\u201d Daly said. \u201cIt is so important for people in Gaza to see that we are able to achieve things despite our disabilities.\u201d As the war continues, the enclave\u2019s amputee crisis has reached unprecedented levels. The U.N. children\u2019s agency, UNICEF, reported that more than 1,000 Palestinian children underwent amputations, many without anesthesia, in the first two months of the war alone. Despite Daly\u2019s unsuccessful bid for this year\u2019s Games, he remains determined to compete in the Los Angeles Summer Paralympics in 2028. However, Gaza\u2019s unpredictable future leaves both his personal and professional plans uncertain. \u201cI have no idea what the next four years will look like for Gaza, but if things stabilize, then I can look forward much more to competing,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this one leg, I represent Palestine everywhere.\u201d For Ali, the fight is not just about making it to international competitions\u2014it is also about surviving. \u201cThe Paralympics was a dream, our North Star, but it wasn\u2019t the reason why we did what we did,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need this war to end. We need freedom. We need peace.\u201d",

                    "post_excerpt": "The Organization of American States\u2019 pro-Israel stance may erode its legitimacy in the region.",
                    "post_content": "Throughout the Israel-Hamas war, Latin American and Caribbean countries have been at the forefront of global efforts to stop the bloodshed in Gaza and defend the human rights of Palestinians. More governments in the region have recalled ambassadors or severed ties with Israel due to the war than in any other region, including the Arab world and sub-Saharan Africa. Officials in roughly half of Latin American and Caribbean countries have described Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza as genocidal, and some have taken steps to pressure the Israeli government to end its indiscriminate military operations there. Colombia, for example\u2014among the most outspoken critics of Israel in Latin America\u2014has suspended its weapons purchases from and halted coal exports to the country, which previously accounted for more than 50 percent of Israel\u2019s annual coal supply. Yet despite this strong regional stance, the Washington, D.C.-based Organization of American States (OAS)\u2014the primary forum for multilateral dialogue in the Western Hemisphere\u2014has not echoed these sentiments. This divergence will further erode the OAS\u2019s legitimacy in the region and may drive countries to other deliberative bodies where the United States holds less influence. On Oct. 7, 2023, OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro condemned the killing of about 1,200 people in southern Israel by Hamas militants, labeling the attack as an act of terrorism and affirming that \u201cIsrael has the right to defend itself.\u201d Since then, as the death toll of Palestinians in Gaza has risen to more than 40,000 people, Almagro has said nothing about the need to protect the human rights of Palestinian civilians. He has been silent about the loss of thousands of Palestinian children\u2019s lives, Israel\u2019s siege of the Gaza Strip, the enclave\u2019s worsening starvation, and reports of torture by Israeli forces against Palestinian prisoners. This stands in sharp contrast to his counterpart at the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who has also repeatedly called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. Almagro\u2019s exclusive support for Israel\u2019s self-defense not only clashes with one of the OAS\u2019s proclaimed principles of defending human rights. It also highlights a significant disconnect between the organization\u2019s leadership and the voting positions held by the majority of its member countries. Of the three resolutions on Israel-Palestine considered at the U.N. General Assembly in the past 11 months\u2014one for a humanitarian truce, another for a cease-fire, and a third backing Palestine\u2019s bid for full U.N. membership\u2014only three OAS nations opposed the first two, and two opposed the third. The United States was the only OAS member to oppose all three resolutions. During the Cold War, the OAS helped legitimize oppressive regimes, such as the U.S.-backed dictatorship of Chile\u2019s Augusto Pinochet, by holding its 1976 Annual Meeting in the country\u2019s capital, Santiago. The OAS also aligned with other anti-democratic interventions that were backed or carried out by the United States, such as the 1954 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Guatemala. Decades on, it appears that neoconservative and other hard-line factions in Washington\u2014and their allies across the Americas\u2014still hold significant sway over the organization, hindering its ability to function as a genuinely democratic multilateral body representing the countries of the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. government, Israel\u2019s principal ally and source of military, economic, and political support, is the largest financial contributor to the OAS, granting Washington substantial leverage over the organization\u2019s agenda. However, this influence alone does not fully account for the OAS leadership\u2019s unyielding stance. Half a dozen current and former senior diplomats at the OAS who were consulted for this article noted that a powerful transnational network of far-right politicians, activists, and organizations have had significant influence over the multilateral institution during Almagro\u2019s two consecutive terms. For example, in 2020, Almagro received the leader of Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party, Santiago Abascal, at the OAS General Secretariat in Washington. Abascal praised the organization as a key bridge for like-minded political movements opposing the \u201cfar left\u201d and sought Almagro\u2019s support for the emerging \u201cMadrid Forum,\u201d an alliance coordinating ultraconservative efforts to oppose progressive movements worldwide. This forum\u2014which includes figures such as far-right Argentine President Javier Milei\u2014continues to enjoy access to the OAS General Secretariat, as illustrated by a meeting it held with the secretary-general in March 2023. Throughout Almagro\u2019s tenure, the OAS has cultivated strong ties with the Israeli government and right-wing networks that support its continued military operations and occupation of Palestinian territories. In 2017, shortly after a U.N. report accused Israel of creating \u201can apartheid regime\u201d over Palestinians, Almagro traveled to Jerusalem and praised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government as a key regional partner, citing its \u201ccommitment to democracy and to human rights.\u201d The OAS secretary-general has also made unprecedented official appearances at the conferences of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2014the pro-Israel lobbying group that is expected to spend $100 million this year to defeat progressive congressional candidates in the United States. These close bonds between the OAS leadership and Israel have translated into policies that reveal a concerning bias. In 2019, Almagro adopted the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism for the OAS, which has been deployed globally to suppress criticism of Israel. Neither the U.N. nor any leading international human rights organizations have embraced the IHRA definition. Additionally, in 2021, the secretary-general created the role of \u201ccommissioner to monitor and combat anti-Semitism,\u201d without establishing equivalent roles within his secretariat to tackle racism against Indigenous or Black populations in the Americas. While antisemitism is a serious issue that deserves condemnation, in the Western Hemisphere, Indigenous and Black communities have been the victims of gross, systemic historical injustices and are more frequently the targets of hate crimes today\u2014including in the United States. Together, they represent a population that is 3,000 percent larger than the Jewish community in the region. The OAS officials consulted for this piece noted that the organization has lost political integrity over the past decade. Unlike Almagro, his predecessor\u2014Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza, who served from 2005 to 2015\u2014maintained a balanced approach by\u00a0condemning Israel\u2019s military actions and supporting U.N. calls for a cease-fire during the 50-day war in Gaza in 2014. Under Insulza, the OAS fostered a platform where diverse viewpoints on the conflict could be expressed, aligning more closely with the organization\u2019s democratic principles. This time around, groups supporting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza have honored Almagro. In April, they granted him an award for \u201chis work countering anti-Semitism.\u201d The event, held at the OAS headquarters in Washington, was dominated by far-right speakers who denounced regional governments that have used diplomatic measures to try to bring about a permanent cease-fire in Gaza. Among the attendees was Republican U.S. Rep. Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar, a staunch defender of former U.S. President Donald Trump who implied that six Latin American presidents have incited hate crimes against Jews with their vocal opposition to the Israel-Hamas war. Only five months earlier, in a video endorsement she made for then-candidate\u2014and now far-right Argentine President\u2014Javier Milei, Salazar praised Argentina for having \u201cone race,\u201d invoking the false, racist idea that Argentina is a country descended from white Europeans and erasing its Black and Indigenous populations. Currently, no OAS member state is considering addressing the Gaza war within the organization. Instead, many countries have turned to other regional fora. Through the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, a multilateral organization that includes all countries of the Americas except the United States and Canada, 24 nations called for an immediate cease-fire as early as March. In July, Brazil leveraged the regional alliance Mercosur to establish a free trade agreement with the Palestinian Authority. Even the 14 nations of the Caribbean, some of which were previously hesitant to express their positions on the Israel-Palestine conflict due to U.S. influence, have now united within the multilateral Caribbean Community organization to recognize the state of Palestine and oppose the war. Of the 35 countries in the Americas, 32 recognize the state of Palestine, with four announcing this decision following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war last year. Yet, in direct contradiction to the positions of most of its members, the OAS\u2019s leadership continues to provide diplomatic cover for the violence perpetrated by the Netanyahu government, which is facing genocide charges at the International Court of Justice\u2014a case supported by seven Latin American and Caribbean countries. Under Almagro\u2019s leadership, the organization continues to drift further from the principles of democracy and human rights that it was supposedly founded to uphold. If the OAS stays on its current trajectory, ignoring and even actively opposing the views of many of its members, it is likely to be seen as increasingly irrelevant in much of the region.",

In each city, the secretary went to the tailor to ask, \u201cFor $100, what can you make me?\u201d The British tailor offered to make a sweater and a tie. The Russian tailor could make a vest and a pair of pants for that sum. But in Jerusalem, the answer came as a surprise. \u201cFor $100 I can make you several shirts, a sport coat, and I\u2019ll throw in a few pairs of pants,\u201d the Israeli tailor said. Stunned, the U.S. diplomat asked how the same money could buy so much more in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite simple,\u201d the tailor replied: \u201cOut here, you\u2019re not so big.\u201d As we mark the first year of the Israel-Hamas war and the escalating crisis on another front between Israel and Hezbollah, nowhere is the United States\u2019 \u201cout here, you\u2019re not so big\u201d problem more stunningly and tragically apparent. The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has not been a potted plant. While the flow of assistance to the suffering population of Gaza has been galactically insufficient, not a scintilla of aid would have gotten through without U.S. pressure. Nor would negotiations to secure the release of 105 out of roughly 252 hostages during the temporary cease-fire in late 2023 have succeeded without a central U.S. role. The Biden administration has also been successful through deterrence, pressure, and diplomacy in preventing the escalation of the Israel-Hamas war into a broader regional war\u2014until now, that is. Nonetheless, it should be painfully obvious that,\u00a0despite its tireless efforts, Washington has been unable to negotiate a cease-fire to de-escalate the Israel-Hamas war, let alone end it. Indeed, over the past year, Washington has failed to fundamentally alter the strategic calculations of the conflict\u2019s two principal decision-makers, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Washington and other allied stakeholders have attempted to pressure and persuade, they have yet to succeed in reshaping the two decision-makers\u2019 convictions that continuing the conflict held greater benefits than de-escalating it. (Israel's ground operation in Lebanon and Iran's missile strikes on Israel this week also demonstrate the way the administration has been unable to control events in the region). Some view the U.S. failure with moral outrage given the deaths of thousands of Palestinian civilians and the humanitarian catastrophe imposed\u00a0upon the people of Gaza. Others just shake their heads, wondering why the world\u2019s most powerful nation\u2014with great leverage over Israel and allies who had significant sway with Hamas\u2014couldn\u2019t do much more to end the conflict. Why not, indeed. That the United States could not have its way through force or diplomacy in response to perhaps the most complex Middle East crisis in decades should have surprised no one. CIA Director William Burns, one of the most astute analysts of Middle East politics, couldn\u2019t have said it better. In his four decades of involvement in the Middle East, Burns said in January that he\u2019d \u201crarely seen it more tangled or explosive.\u201d Indeed, the complexity of the conflict has only highlighted the limitations of outside powers. In a conflict where the stakes are perceived to be existential\u2014involving the political or physical survival of key decision-makers and the traumas to their respective publics\u2014the ability of outside powers to exert significant influence diminishes. At the same time, local resistance to external pressure grows. The attack on Oct. 7, 2023, was a unique and unprecedented crisis that only magnified the \u201cout here, you\u2019re not so big\u201d problem, leaving the United States in the role of a modern-day Gulliver, wandering around the region, tied up by the interests of smaller powers that were not its own and driven to try well-intentioned diplomacy that had little chance of succeeding. The Oct. 7 Problem Oct. 7 presented\u00a0the Biden administration with a veritable mission impossible. Hamas\u2019s indiscriminate killing, raping, torture of civilians, and hostage-taking was followed by Israel\u2019s punishing airstrikes, which seemed to put a focus on damage rather than accuracy. The invasion that followed guaranteed thousands of civilian deaths, given Hamas\u2019s decision to collocate its military assets in, around, and below civilian populations and structures, and virtually guaranteed that U.S. influence would be limited. Indeed, through most of the last year, it was Netanyahu and Sinwar who controlled the trajectory of the conflict, leaving the United States to react to the table they set.\u00a0Israel\u2019s goals were maximalist: to destroy Hamas as a military organization and end its control of Gaza. And Netanyahu\u2019s politics\u2014his constant looking into the rearview mirror to ensure that his extremist ministers wouldn\u2019t bolt from the governing coalition\u2014hovered over his security decisions, making it impossible to do any postwar planning and facilitate a steady flow of badly needed assistance to Gaza. Sinwar\u2019s goals focused on restoring the centrality of Palestinian rights on the international and regional agenda; blocking normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia; and demonstrating that it was Hamas, not Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, that was to be the agent of Palestinian redemption. He also hoped to incite a broader war between Israel and regional countries. In any case, reconciling what Sinwar sought and what Netanyahu wanted was impossible. These were hardly the kind of positions that would lend themselves to a negotiation that the United States could broker. The Biden administration\u2019s influence was further constrained by the nature of a conflict between a close U.S. ally and a group that, by statute and force of law, the United States considers a foreign terror organization. Biden\u2019s emotional statement in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre and his early visit to Israel reflected his deep and abiding support for the country. These served to tether Washington to Israel\u2019s war aims almost from the outset and left little incentive to pressure Israel, let alone break with the Netanyahu government over disagreements with Israeli tactics and how to achieve those aims. Toughness with Israel was invariably interpreted as being weak on Hamas\u2014an unsustainable position in light of Hamas\u2019s taking, abusing, and murdering hostages, including Americans. Once the United States developed the idea of an Israel-Hamas cease-fire as a mechanism to de-escalate the war, Washington was forced to work within the parameters of the two leaders, neither of whom saw much value or utility in closing a deal. The United States was played by both sides. And neither Qatar nor Egypt, the primary go-betweens for Hamas, had the power, incentive, or inclination to appear to be pressing Hamas while Israelis were carrying on a war against the group\u2014and in the process wreaking misery on the Palestinian population. The Netanyahu Problem Perhaps nowhere is the \u201cout here, you\u2019re not so big\u201d challenge more acutely demonstrated than in the dynamic between the Biden administration and Netanyahu, the longest-governing prime minister in the history of Israel. Long mistrustful of the United States, Netanyahu has played the president and the administration, at times crudely, at times like a finely tuned violin. Let\u2019s be clear: Hamas leader Sinwar also played the Americans. But Sinwar heads a militant organization that executes Americans and is inimically opposed to U.S. interests. He\u2019s not the leader of a country closely aligned with the United States and its president, whose support for Israel seemed to have no limit. No reciprocity or cooperation is to be expected from Hamas. In Netanyahu\u2019s case, the image of a close ally seemingly exploiting the largess of another highlights the perennial problem of the small power taking advantage of the big. And when it becomes a pattern of behavior, it reflects the paradox of the small power demonstrating focus and strength and the dominant power exhibiting weakness and indecision. U.S.-Israel relations have had their ups and downs in the past. And former U.S. presidents and Israeli prime ministers have argued over policy. But what made the current Biden-Netanyahu dynamic even worse and diminished U.S. credibility even further was the perception\u2014grounded in reality\u2014that the divide wasn\u2019t so much driven by Israel\u2019s national interests but by Netanyahu\u2019s political interests. What this meant in practice was that on many issues\u2014facilitating international assistance into Gaza,\u00a0 prioritizing the return of hostages, planning for postwar Gaza, and avoiding an explosive situation on the West Bank\u2014Netanyahu\u2019s decision-making was shaped by the demands and requirements of his right-wing government, particularly his two extremist ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir. This dynamic was most clearly on display when it came to negotiations over an Israel-Hamas cease-fire, highlighting the humiliation and embarrassment of the big power at the hands of the small. Time and again, the prime minister would say yes, then maybe, and then no. Netanyahu would send his negotiators but with\u00a0limited mandates. Sinwar was clearly as much responsible\u2014perhaps even more, in the wake of Hamas\u2019s execution of six hostages\u2014for the impasse as Netanyahu. But Sinwar wasn\u2019t conveying commitments directly to the president and senior administration officials. Indeed, just last week, Netanyahu committed himself to a U.S.-French proposal for a cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon only to walk that commitment back, temporarily seeming to endorse its aims while knowing full well that he had set into motion the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The Leverage Problem So if the great power is being taken advantage of by smaller ones, then why doesn\u2019t the Biden administration\u2014or the vaunted international community, for that matter\u2014impose a single cost or consequence on Israel or Hamas that would alter the trajectory of the conflict? Let\u2019s do the easy ones first. We have no answer to the question of how to alter the behavior of a Palestinian decision-maker safely ensconced in tunnels that have not been made accessible to the thousands of Palestinian civilians exposed and killed by Israeli bombs. Having spent two decades in Israeli prisons, Sinwar surely knew how Israel would respond to Oct. 7, how many Palestinians would die, and how he would at some point meet his end at the hands of Israel. Whether any single Arab state or collection of states could force Sinwar to end the conflict or agree to de-escalate it will have to remain a thought experiment. None was likely able or willing to try. As for Israel, it should be quite clear by now that the Biden administration, like most of its predecessors, has been unwilling and unable to apply maximum pressure, let alone break with its Israeli ally over the conduct of Israel\u2019s prosecution of its wars against Hamas or Hezbollah. Former presidents have been willing to use discrete pressure at times. The Nixon administration kept Israel from destroying Egypt\u2019s third army to preserve prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough between Egypt and Israel. Former President Ronald Reagan suspended the delivery of advanced fighter aircraft over Israeli policies in Lebanon. The administration of George\u00a0H.W. Bush\u00a0denied housing loan guarantees because of Israel\u2019s settlement construction as it was trying to put together the Madrid peace conference. In fact, when I first heard the anecdote about the Israeli tailor, it was attributed to Bush\u2019s secretary of state, James Baker. I asked Baker whether it was his yarn\u2014he laughed and said he wished it was. But real pressure? You\u2019d need to go back to the Eisenhower administration, when the president threatened to sanction Israel unless it withdrew its forces from Sinai during the failed British-French-Israeli campaign to seize the Suez Canal from President Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s Egypt. It\u2019s not that the Biden administration lacks leverage on Israel. The president has many tools in his arsenal, such as conditioning or restricting U.S. military assistance to Israel; introducing or supporting a United Nations Security Council resolution that is critical of its policies in Gaza; demonstrating its displeasure by joining 140-plus countries\u2014most recently Ireland, Spain, and Norway\u2014in recognizing a Palestinian state, or joining near-international consensus in calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities, threatening consequences if neither side complied. Biden chose none of these actions due to a confluence of factors: the president\u2019s deep emotional commitment to the idea, security, and people of Israel honed over decades; the United States\u2019 domestic political landscape, where the Republican Party has emerged as the \u201cIsrael-can-do-no-wrong\u201d party, and a policy fixated on a cease-fire that required the agreement of both Israel and Hamas. Biden\u2019s anger grew\u00a0and slipped out from time to time. But with the exception of a\u00a0delay in the shipment of some heavy bombs, that anger never translated into concrete or sustained changes in policy. Would the application of pressure have worked? We\u2019ll never know, though there\u2019s reason to doubt it. Stephen M. Walt argued here in Foreign Policy that a patron\u2019s leverage over a client diminishes when the matter at hand is of vital importance to the latter and when shared values as well as political and institutional constraints impose costs on the patron for exerting pressure. Add to that the often ignored but critically important reality that when it comes to its friends, partners, and allies, the United States rarely (if ever) uses sustained pressure or leverage on an issue that the latter considers vital to its own national or political interests. And if few U.S. presidents want to tangle with their friends that lack significant political resonance, why would a president want to break with an ally that has significant domestic support? No U.S. administration has ever faced a situation with its Israeli ally quite like Oct. 7, where the unique nature of the conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah were seen in near existential terms; an Israeli prime minister was determined to do most anything to remain in power; and the absence of a realistic diplomatic pathway combined with a preternaturally pro-Israeli president and domestic politics, especially in an election year, to limit the United States\u2019 options and influence. It\u2019s Not Our Neighborhood The story of the secretary and the tailor makes a powerful point that U.S. diplomats and negotiators often forget: For all their military and political muscle, great powers are not always so great when they get mixed up in the affairs of smaller ones in a neighborhood owned by the latter. The U.S. experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, where the standard for victory was never \u201ccould we win\u201d but rather \u201cwhen can we leave and what will we leave behind,\u201d is perhaps the most tragic cautionary tale. And the set of U.S. diplomatic successes in helping to resolve the long-term Arab-Israeli conflict is stunningly small. The United States has had great success against the Islamic State and al Qaeda and has kept the homeland secure from foreign terrorist attacks. But the Middle East is littered with the remains of great powers who wrongly believed that they could impose their will, schemes, ambitions, dreams, and peace plans on smaller ones. Indeed, this region is more often than not a place where American ideas go to wither or die. This is particularly the case in conflicts that have long histories where identity, trauma, memory, and religion play dominant roles. As we mark the first year after Oct. 7, we should remind ourselves that ignoring the region, let alone leaving it to its own devices, isn\u2019t an option. But neither is transformation. The United States has allies, interests, adversaries, and vital interests there. The locals will always have a greater stake; be more invested; and be willing to run greater risks for good or ill than the United States ever will. U.S. leadership is important, but it isn\u2019t the key. What matters more is having Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are masters of their politics, not prisoners of their ideologies\u2014leaders who are not extractive and who care about the future of their own people and are willing to reach out to one another with a vision of a shared future. Without that, we have nothing; with it, we at least have a chance to create a better pathway forward for Israelis and Palestinians alike.",

                    "post_content": "The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has deteriorated further over the past month, according to an assessment by aid groups, despite demands made by the Biden administration that Israel take specific steps to improve the situation within 30 days or risk jeopardizing the ongoing supply of U.S. arms. A scorecard issued by eight aid organizations\u2014including Mercy Corps, Save the Children, and Oxfam\u2014found that there has been no improvement on most of the metrics laid out in an Oct. 13 letter that the Biden administration sent to the Israeli government. Overall, the report concludes that the situation in Gaza has only declined during the 30-day period set out in the letter. While most benchmarks were marked for noncompliance, others were listed as partially implemented. \u201cIsrael\u2019s actions failed to meet any of the specific criteria set out in the U.S. letter,\u201d the report said. \u201cIsrael not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in northern Gaza.\u201d Tuesday marks the letter\u2019s deadline for the Israeli government to take concrete steps to halt the spiraling catastrophe in Gaza or risk a review of U.S. arms deliveries under a memorandum issued by the Biden administration that says recipients of U.S. weapons must not impede the delivery of humanitarian aid. The White House, Defense Department, and State Department did not respond to requests for comment on the aid groups\u2019 findings. The Israeli Embassy in Washington also did not provide a comment. The Biden administration has yet to announce its final assessment of whether Israel has adequately complied, but it has recently signaled that the country has not done enough to meet the demands. On Nov. 4, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that the situation in Gaza \u201chas not significantly turned around,\u201d noting that the stipulations laid out in the letter had not yet been met. It is unclear if the White House will impose an arms embargo or other repercussions on Israel if it is found to not have complied\u2014or how much leverage Biden now has over the actions of the Israeli government with a new administration set to take the White House in January, following President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election. Despite Israel allowing a temporary surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza between May and August 2024, September saw the lowest volume of aid supplies allowed into the territory since this March. Around 1.84 million Palestinians across the Gaza Strip face high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the United Nations, including nearly 133,000 people facing catastrophic food insecurity. That number is expected to almost triple by April 2025. \u201cThe entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and violence,\u201d the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, the U.N.\u2019s highest-level humanitarian coordination forum, wrote in November. Acute malnutrition in Gaza is at levels 10 times higher than before the Israel-Hamas war broke out in October 2023. Last Friday, a U.N.-backed panel warned that famine in northern Gaza is \u201cimminent\u201d and that action is needed \u201cwithin days, not weeks.\u201d Yet Israel has been slow to respond. The Biden administration\u2019s letter stipulated that 350 trucks of food and assistance be allowed into Gaza daily, which is below the 500 vehicles that entered daily before the war began. According to the humanitarian groups\u2019 assessment\u2014which was drafted five days before Tuesday\u2019s deadline\u2014an average of 42 trucks a day entered the territory during the review period. Data from an Israeli military unit responsible for overseeing government activities in the West Bank and Gaza shows that a total of 1,789 trucks entered Gaza in October\u2014an average of almost 58 per day. Commercial deliveries of food have also come to a \u201ccomplete halt,\u201d further straining food supplies and driving up prices for the little that remains, said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps, one of the groups involved in preparing the report. \u201cOur staff are reporting there is almost nothing in the markets to buy, and what is there is completely out of reach.\u201d According to the report, Israel has failed to reinstate a minimum of 50 to 100 commercial trucks daily. On Monday, hours before the Biden administration\u2019s deadline expired, the Israeli military announced that it would expand the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone in southern Gaza to include field hospitals; tent compounds; shelter supplies; and provisions of food, water, medicine, and medical equipment. Despite being a designated safe zone and Israel having ordered Gaza residents in other areas to evacuate there, Israeli attacks have repeatedly hit al-Mawasi. Israeli officials maintain that their forces only target Hamas militants and that they continue to take steps to avoid civilian casualties. More than 43,500 people in Gaza have been killed since the conflict began, though local authorities believe the true number is likely much higher. Last Friday, the U.N. human rights office confirmed that nearly 70 percent of those killed were women and children. Experts worry that Israel\u2019s decision last week to end cooperation with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in January 2025 will only worsen these conditions; allowing UNRWA access to Gaza was a key benchmark in Biden\u2019s letter. The continued throttling of aid into the besieged territory comes after 13 months of war, displacement, and food insecurity that have already taken a steep toll on Palestinian civilians, who are now heading into their second winter of the war amid warnings of an imminent famine. \u201cThis is really the tipping point,\u201d Phillips-Barrasso said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at a situation that could tip and unravel very, very quickly.\u201d",

                    "post_content": "On Oct. 13, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin sent an extraordinary letter to their Israeli counterparts. It outlined how Israel is impeding humanitarian assistance in Gaza and demanded that the country take concrete steps to alleviate the crisis in 30 days or risk losing U.S. military aid. The deadline is here. Much has changed since that letter was sent: Donald Trump has been elected president of the United States; Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, one of the letter\u2019s recipients, has been sacked; and Israel\u2019s parliament has passed two laws to stop the essential work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza and the West Bank. What has not changed is that the Israeli government continues to arbitrarily impede lifesaving aid from reaching Palestinians in desperate need and uses U.S. weapons to cause indiscriminate death and destruction across Gaza. But in the final weeks of his term, U.S. President Joe Biden has a unique opportunity to rectify this. Instead of continuing to defend Israel\u2019s execution of the war, his administration should simply acknowledge the facts: Israel continues to block humanitarian assistance and therefore, according to U.S. law, cannot receive U.S. weapons. Despite repeatedly claiming otherwise, Israeli authorities have hindered every aspect of the complex humanitarian mission in Gaza since the war began more than a year ago.\u00a0The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has documented clear signs of this: trucks stuck at the border; limited crossing points and ports; restricted operating times; delayed authorization for truck drivers, medical staff, and aid workers; and a confounding array of bureaucratic impediments, such as the ever-changing list of items Israel considers potential weapons, from flashlights to surgical scissors. Meanwhile, nearly the entire population of Gaza has been forcibly displaced. Every quantifiable indicator of health, nutrition, water, sanitation, shelter, protection, and access to aid has plummeted below what is usually seen in conflicts. And aid organizations are at the mercy of Israel\u2019s haphazard system whereby they must notify the Israeli military of their locations to avoid being targeted in a military operation.\u00a0The result is that more than 300 aid workers have been killed\u2014the highest number ever recorded in a single crisis. On Tuesday, eight humanitarian organizations with operations in Gaza released a scorecard grading Israel\u2019s compliance with the changes requested in the Oct. 13 letter. They concluded that Israel not only failed to meet almost all the requirements in the letter but also took additional actions that dramatically worsened the humanitarian situation, particularly in northern Gaza. Take, for example, the oft-discussed metric of the number of trucks allowed to enter Gaza. The Oct. 13 letter required that Israel allow a minimum of 350 trucks to enter Gaza daily, but the scorecard found that in the 30 days since then, only an average of 42 trucks had entered each day. On some days, that number was as low as six trucks. Even State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said that from Nov. 1-9, Israel allowed only 404 trucks total into Gaza over the whole nine-day period. As a result, conditions in Gaza are even worse today than when Blinken and Austin sent their letter. In the last 30 days, around 1,400 people there have been killed, including in an Oct. 29 airstrike on a five-story residential building in Beit Lahia that killed at least 90 people\u201420 of whom were children. This brings the death toll in Gaza to more than 43,600, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, though local authorities believe the actual number is likely much higher. Last week, the Israeli military announced that displaced civilians in northern Gaza\u2014which is being destroyed and depopulated under conditions that top U.N. officials recently described as \u201capocalyptic\u201d\u2014would not be allowed to return to their homes, in flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law. Furthermore, on Nov. 8, an international group of food security experts issued an alert that all of Gaza faces acute food insecurity and that there is a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent\u201d for the estimated 75,000 to 90,000 people stuck in northern Gaza. To be clear, Israel is not responsible for all the challenges of delivering aid.\u00a0Both Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces have killed civilians in Gaza and destroyed basic infrastructure in the region. In addition, more than 1.8 million people in Gaza face \u201cextremely critical\u201d levels of hunger, and starvation has led desperate Palestinians to loot aid convoys. But when lifesaving relief needs to be flooding into every area of Gaza, Israel controls the spigot, turning it on and off seemingly at random. A simple test of whether humanitarian assistance is being arbitrarily impeded is to ask how Israel would act if its own citizens were in need:\u00a0Would there be limitations on the amount of food or the number of trucks, drivers, doctors, and aid workers allowed inside the country? Would entire containers of relief goods be impounded for containing scissors?\u00a0Would schools sheltering displaced Israeli families be bombed to kill suspected enemies? Since early on in this conflict, the U.S. State Department has had all the information it needs to accurately determine if Israel has been obstructing humanitarian assistance, but it has chosen to prioritize unconditional support of Israel over U.S. law. In May, the State and Defense departments submitted a report to Congress that concluded that Israel was not blocking humanitarian assistance. However, aid organizations and experts in the State Department\u2019s refugee bureau and the United States Agency for International Development had been reporting otherwise for months. I know this because as the senior civil-military advisor in the refugee bureau, I was one of the subject matter experts working on that report until my colleagues and I were removed from it so it could be edited at a higher level. The report\u2019s final determination was made to skirt Section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act, a law that requires halting assistance to a country that blocks U.S. humanitarian aid. I told State Department leadership that the demonstrably false report would haunt us, and I resigned. Now in the waning weeks before the inauguration of a new president, the Biden administration has this last chance to do the right thing.\u00a0The task is straightforward: Look at the facts and make an honest determination about whether the Israeli government\u2019s actions have helped or hurt the people of Gaza. Halting the delivery of U.S. weapons to Israel now may be cynically considered an insignificant step that could be overturned by the next administration, but it would be a brave return to U.S. law and humanitarian principles, however brief.\u00a0It\u2019s never too late to obey the law.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The Biden administration\u2019s disavowal of students\u2019 concerns will only make things worse.",
                    "post_content": "Throughout the academic year that is now concluding on U.S. university campuses, there has been a contentious debate about the language used in protests over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One of the most hotly disputed terms is the Arabic word intifada, which in a political context means \u201cpopular uprising.\u201d As students have chanted slogans such as \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d at protests against Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, commentators have alternately denounced their language as antisemitic, defended it as an anodyne statement of support for Palestinian resistance, and sought to parse its meaning through linguistic and historical interpretation. Yet even amid this battle over slogans, the students have achieved something momentous: Their protest movement\u2014to an unprecedented degree\u2014has globalized the cause of protecting Palestinian lives from the onslaught of Israeli bombing and securing statehood for Palestinians. Evidence of this abounds, from the spread of protests to campuses in Europe and elsewhere to the powerful criticism of U.S. weapons aid to Israel that was conveyed in a speech given in President Joe Biden\u2019s presence at last weekend\u2019s baccalaureate ceremony at Morehouse College, one of the United States\u2019 most prestigious historically Black colleges. The Cannes Film Festival also become a backdrop for protest, with Australian actress Cate Blanchett wearing a gown that appeared to incorporate elements of the Palestinian flag. More recently, Spain, Ireland, and Norway recognized Palestinian statehood, adding three wealthy European states to a list of more than 140 countries that recognize Palestine\u2014a list that is dominated by the global south. And on Friday, the International Court of Justice\u00a0ruled\u00a0that Israel must immediately stop its military offensive in the Gaza city of Rafah. Historically, certain positions in U.S. foreign policy have enjoyed such strong bipartisan support that they seldom generate fundamental national debate and are rarely reexamined by the mainstream media. Throughout most of the Cold War, the premier instance of this kind of consensus was Americans\u2019 treatment of competition with the Soviet Union as an existential matter. Until former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, other examples of these positions included U.S. support for NATO and, albeit less often discussed, Washington\u2019s Asian alliances, especially with Japan. As pillars go, Washington\u2019s longtime and largely unquestioned support for Israel has been on a level commensurate with commitments such as these: so deep and solid that they are nearly impervious to discussion and debate. Like nothing before, the protests that have recently roiled U.S. campuses have changed this. Here comes the moment for some sincere throat clearing. I have no difficulty whatsoever condemning Hamas\u2019s sickening attack on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, 2023. I also readily accept the premise that Israel has the right to defend itself, along with the unfortunate reality that no conceivable response could have fully avoided the death of innocent civilians in Gaza. This cannot be taken, however, as a license for mass casualties. I also support Israel\u2019s right to exist as a state. What that means in practice is complicated; how Zionism should be defined, how Israeli laws should be written and applied, and what kind of dispensation is reserved for non-Jewish citizens of that country are all topics that Israelis and Jews worldwide actively debate. They are all beyond the scope of this column. Where student protesters have rendered a tremendous service is in saying that with the offensive in Gaza\u2014with its possibly underestimated 35,000-person death toll; its destruction of housing, hospitals, schools, and infrastructure on an almost unimaginable scale; its repeated displacement of the population to clear the way for further offensives; its attacks on relief workers and journalists; its restrictions on the press; and its vice-like control on humanitarian food deliveries to the point where mass starvation now threatens\u2014Israel has gone too far. Washington\u2019s failure to find a strong voice on these topics has driven citizens to action. So has the associated reticence or timidity of much of the U.S. media, where the leading newspapers (some of which have issued guidelines discouraging the use of the word \u201cPalestine\u201d) are far more comfortable obsessing over the daily theatrics of Trump\u2019s ongoing legal battles. In a democracy, action does not and should not only take place at the ballot box. Student protests are part a tradition of citizen activism in the United States, and putting aside the very occasional incidence of violence and hate speech (each from a variety of directions), the demand for action to relieve the plight of Palestinians falls within a venerable and necessary heritage. Unfortunately, the U.S. establishment\u2019s disavowal of the current movement and refusal to hear protesters\u2019 concerns\u2014or in the case of canceled graduation ceremonies and student speeches, the refusal to even allow students\u2019 words to be spoken publicly\u2014have only made things worse. Here, Biden has led in the precisely wrong direction. In response to the announcement on Monday that the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) would seek arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, Biden angrily rejected the notion of any \u201cequivalence\u201d between the leaders of Hamas, for whom warrants were also requested, and Israel\u2019s leaders. In saying this, Biden revisited details of some of the most gruesome charges against Hamas for its Oct. 7 attack. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has alarmingly gone one step further than Biden, undermining U.S. claims to support a rules-based international order by saying that the administration would support a push in the U.S. Congress to sanction the ICC for its pursuit of arrest warrants. France, by contrast, quickly stated support for the ICC in its \u201cfight against impunity.\u201d Even the chancellor of Germany, one of Europe\u2019s most stalwart supports of Israel and closest allies of the United States, said that his country would arrest Netanyahu if the ICC issues a warrant against him. Many problems arise from Biden\u2019s statement. First, the ICC made no equivalence between Israel\u2019s leaders and those of Hamas, other than the principled claim at the heart of its filing, which asserts that the leaders of both parties are responsible for crimes for which they must answer before international law. Secondly, by revisiting the warranted horror of Hamas\u2019s butchery of Israelis, Biden is inviting the very sorts of parallels that he claims are unwarranted. As someone who covered catastrophic, revenge-driven wars in Africa earlier in my career, I learned long ago that comparative moral claims amid abominations are dubious exercises. But throughout this crisis, Biden has found the time and passion to conjure details about the suffering of Israelis to a degree that he has simply never shown himself willing or capable of doing with regard to unthinkably devastated Palestinians. And this has been the key problem that campus demonstrators have sought to crack: Complaints about the fate of Palestinians\u2014whether amid the present conflict or more existentially, in terms of the resolution of their enduring statelessness\u2014are treated like undeliverable mail, returned to sender, as administration after administration provides blanket support for Israel, even as its settlements grow, while blithely mouthing formulaic and unactionable theoretical support for a two-state solution. With his nearly unreserved capacity for public support of Israel\u2014which is led by a cabinet that, even beyond Hamas, appears to be opposed to working with the Palestinian Authority, and some of whose members support emptying Gaza or annexing it outright\u2014Biden appears to be incapable of understanding just how tight a corner he is backing himself into. It is right and proper to denounce antisemitism, but in raising his voice in anger about the ongoing protests in general, he risks losing a great deal of the youth vote that he appears to desperately need in the upcoming electoral battle with Trump, the presumptive Republican Party nominee. There are, of course, bad apples in every crowd, but these are not protests driven by animosity or hatred toward Jewish people. They are an expression of refusal to accept killing on such a large scale, and of impatience with a U.S. foreign policy that has long claimed a moral right to lead the world, and yet has proved ineffective in achieving more just outcomes in a part of the world that the United States has long treated as a top priority.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Berlin\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel has eroded its soft-power footprint in the region.",
                    "post_content": "Last October, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Tunisia, Peter Pr\u00fcgel, sparked controversy while speaking at the opening of a new secondary school in the suburbs of Tunis. After Tunisia\u2019s education minister expressed solidarity with Gaza during the event, Pr\u00fcgel described Israelis as victims of \u201cPalestinian terror,\u201d a reference to Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel. The education minister angrily objected, asserting that the ambassador\u2019s words ran contrary to Tunisia\u2019s position on the Israel-Hamas war, and Pr\u00fcgel left the event in a hurry. Online, some Tunisians soon claimed that Pr\u00fcgel had justified Israel\u2019s killing of civilians in Gaza. The embassy insisted that Pr\u00fcgel had expressed sympathy for all victims, but said that \u201cwe could not ignore that this escalation was caused by Hamas\u2019s barbaric terror attack on Israel.\u201d Days later, demonstrators gathered outside the German Embassy to demand Pr\u00fcgel\u2019s resignation. Protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza had already targeted the U.S. and French embassies in Tunis, but this was the first time they had turned their ire toward Germany. German tabloid Bild described criticism of Pr\u00fcgel as a \u201chate attack\u201d and reminded its readers that the new school, partly funded by Germany\u2019s development bank, was only opened thanks to the country\u2019s generosity. For decades, Germany has sought to reconcile a perceived historic responsibility to Israel with a cordial relationship toward the Arab world. Berlin developed a major soft-power footprint and was long seen as an honest broker in trade and economic relations. Organizations financed largely by the German government\u2014such as the Goethe Institute, development agency GIZ, and foundations linked to the country\u2019s main political parties\u2014are major funders of various programs across the Middle East. Since Oct. 7, this balancing act has faltered. Across the Middle East, there is growing support for Palestinian resistance\u2014and condemnation of what many Arabs consider a genocidal war by Israel. Germany, shocked by the worst single-day massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, initially backed Israel\u2019s assault in Gaza largely without qualification, though some officials have taken a more critical position in recent weeks. Still, Berlin continues to assert itself as one of Israel\u2019s closest political and military allies, even as\u2014after more than seven months of Israeli bombardment\u2014more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and the enclave is experiencing widespread famine. Germany\u2019s uncompromising reaction to the war has rapidly tarnished its reputation across the Middle East. Germany\u2019s image is suffering across the Arab world. A 2020 survey by the Arab Center Washington DC found that a slight majority of the Arab public had positive views of German foreign policy. This January, by contrast, a poll of residents of 16 Arab countries published by the Doha Institute showed that 75 percent of respondents had a negative opinion of the country\u2019s stance on the Israel-Hamas war. Morocco-based sociologist Amro Ali, who studies the relationship between Germany and the Arab world, described this as a 180-degree turn in public opinion. Positive impressions of Germany had long dominated in the Middle East: The country was associated with fast cars, high-tech products, and friendly tourists. The German government refused to take part in the Iraq War and welcomed more than 1 million Syrian refugees in 2015 and 2016. Berlin, home to Europe\u2019s largest Palestinian diaspora, has become a hub for Arab culture and intellectual life. Germany also lacks the direct colonial legacy in the Middle East that still feeds regional distrust of powers such as France and the United Kingdom. Five days after Oct. 7, in a speech that established Germany\u2019s tone toward the nascent Israel-Hamas war, Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the Bundestag that \u201c[in] this moment, there is only one place for Germany: the place by Israel\u2019s side.\u201d By November 2023, Germany had licensed a nearly tenfold increase in arms exports to Israel, becoming the second-biggest arms supplier to the country since the war\u2019s start, after the United States. As public figures in Germany expressed solidarity with Israel, police cracked down on pro-Palestinian demonstrations, violently dispersing them or banning them on grounds of antisemitism. Artists and intellectuals who are critical of Israel, including Jews and Arabs, have warned of a wave of silencing across German society; many have seen awards and funding revoked or events canceled. Among them are Palestinian author Adania Shibli, whose award ceremony was called off by the Frankfurt Book Fair in October, and Lebanese-Egyptian anthropologist Ghassan Hage, who was fired in February by the prestigious Max Planck Institute, which said views that Hage had shared on social media were \u201cincompatible\u201d with its values. On social media, Ali noticed something he had never seen before: Young people across the Arab world were posting daily about Germany\u2014and none of their impressions were positive. He links the changing perceptions of the country to a reorientation of global politics, in which Western support for Israel has become a source of unbearable hypocrisy for many in the global south. \u201cWe really see some big shifts happening, and one of the key players that\u2019s contributing to this is Germany,\u201d Ali said. This change in public opinion is unlikely to affect Germany\u2019s political or economic relations with Arab states. Yet it has the potential to undercut Berlin\u2019s soft power in the region. Foreign Policy spoke with nine current and former staff of six German institutions that do work across five Middle Eastern countries. They said that Germany\u2019s hard-line position on the Israel-Hamas war has jeopardized their work with local partners and communities\u2014damaging trust and credibility that have taken years or decades to develop. All spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their careers. The West German government first sought to build relations with Israel when it agreed to pay Holocaust reparations to the young state in 1952. Then-Chancellor Konrad Adenauer saw reparations as a means to restore Germany\u2019s reputation and reintegrate itself with Western powers. The Arab League objected to Adenauer\u2019s plan, arguing that Germany should not financially support a state that was at war with its Arab neighbors and had refused to take responsibility for the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in 1948. The Arab League \u201cstated that Germany should not solve its problem on the backs of Arabs or Palestinians,\u201d said Daniel Marwecki, a historian of Germany\u2019s relations with Israel and lecturer at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cThat has been the issue ever since.\u201d The two-state solution set out in the 1994 Oslo Accords offered Berlin a chance to clear the slate. Germany became a key supporter of negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 2023, Germany, directly and via the European Union, was the second-largest national donor in the Palestinian territories and to the United Nations Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), behind only the United States in the latter ranking. \u201cThe idea was: If you just throw money at the process, things are going to get resolved,\u201d Marwecki said. \u201cThe U.S. will take the political leadership\u2014we\u2019re just going to follow checkbook diplomacy.\u201d In the 2000s, as the Oslo process failed, Germany drew closer to Israel on matters of security. Berlin\u2019s foreign policy became increasingly tied up with domestic anxieties about antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment among Muslims in Germany, which some politicians said obstructed the country\u2019s attempts to overcome its history. Longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel summed up Germany\u2019s position during a speech to the Knesset in 2008, when she said that Israel\u2019s security was Germany\u2019s Staatsraison, or reason of state\u2014a term repeated by Scholz and others after Oct 7. When Merkel put the blame for the 2006 Lebanon War and 2008 Gaza War entirely on Hezbollah and Hamas respectively, there was still occasional opposition to the Israeli military\u2019s operations expressed by officials within the German government; in 2008, a leading Social Democratic politician accused the then-chancellor of \u201ctaking the side of permanent Israeli bombardment.\u201d But Israel\u2019s military conduct in wars in Gaza in 2014 and 2021 earned relatively little criticism from German politicians of any party. Although Germany continued to oppose the construction of illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and expressed alarm at the anti-democratic tendencies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right coalition, these policy differences did not substantively alter the Germany-Israel relationship. In the months after Oct. 7, German leaders fixated on the victims of Hamas\u2019s attack, the fate of hostages in Gaza, rising antisemitism, and what they perceived to be Hamas\u2019s existential threat to Israel\u2019s security. The welfare of Palestinian civilians received notably less attention than in previous conflicts, even amid historic levels of death and destruction in Gaza. Last October, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Hamas had taken the entirety of Gaza hostage and repeated Israel\u2019s claims that the militant group was using civilians as human shields. Germany continued to reject calls for a cease-fire, which Scholz said would allow Hamas to rearm, and abstained from a December 2023 United Nations vote calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. As Palestinian deaths in Gaza climbed to more than 20,000 in January, German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck denied that Israel was targeting civilians; while some may object to the Israeli military\u2019s \u201charsh measures,\u201d he said, accusations of genocide against Israel were false. Germany labeled South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice as \u201cpolitical instrumentalization\u201d and froze its funding for UNRWA after Israel alleged that some of its staff participated in the Oct. 7 attack. (Germany has since reinstated \u00a0its UNRWA funding after an independent review found that Israel provided insufficient evidence for its claims.) The government\u2019s views are rarely shared by staff of German institutions with experience in the Middle East. They have long admitted in private what cannot be said publicly in Germany, sources told Foreign Policy: The two-state solution is dead, Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank amounts to apartheid, and German foreign policy is unmoored from the realities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The divide between German organizations\u2019 headquarters and their outposts in the Middle East has only grown starker since Oct 7. Staff across institutions in several countries say that using terms such as \u201capartheid\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d in reference to Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians\u2014phrasing rejected and considered antisemitic by the German government\u2014is common among immediate colleagues. They say their work has been impaired by Germany\u2019s support for the war, their own organizations\u2019 silence or support for Israel, and blowback related to the repression of pro-Palestinian voices in Germany. Several weeks after the protests against Pr\u00fcgel in Tunis, a swastika was painted on the walls of the city\u2019s local branch of the Goethe Institute, the German government\u2019s flagship global cultural institution. The organization canceled a series of school visits and a film screening in the capital and made a planned public exhibition invite-only. It has also canceled events in Beirut and Ramallah due to security concerns. In March, the Egyptian artist Mohamed Abla returned an award from the institute to protest Germany\u2019s support for Israel; the organization had faced backlash in 2022 for canceling a talk with Palestinian writer Mohammed El-Kurd. Three current and former staff members at GIZ told Foreign Policy that Germany\u2019s complicity in the war has caused outrage within the development agency. GIZ has not taken a public stance on the conflict, even after one of its own Palestinian employees was put in administrative detention\u2014without a trial or charges\u2014by Israel in March. (This differs from GIZ\u2019s strong position against Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.) At least two Palestinian nongovernmental organizations that GIZ worked with are now boycotting the agency, the sources said. One described an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d atmosphere that has led some staff to fear speaking out and others to quit. \u201cYou fund the bombing on one side, and you throw a little bit of aid to show you\u2019re a humanitarian,\u201d the source said of Germany\u2019s actions. To keep a low profile and protect their local staff and partners, many German organizations doing work in the Middle East have quietly canceled public events, postponed the publication of reports, or removed their logos from the projects they support. Several sources said they fear that the German media or government could accuse their organizations or their local partners of antisemitism if anyone affiliated with them supports the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions (BDS) movement or criticizes Israel on social media. The German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, which funds GIZ and the party foundations\u2019 work abroad, has said partner organizations are subject to \u201cclose scrutiny\u201d and checked for any statements that are antisemitic, deny Israel\u2019s right to exist, or support BDS. The ministry and foreign office are currently implementing cuts of nearly 1.5 billion euros as Germany slashes its international aid and development budget. Last December, Germany removed funding for a project to support victims of trafficking aided by the Centre for Egyptian Women\u2019s Legal Assistance after its leader signed a letter condemning the war and supporting BDS. During a post-Oct. 7 review, Germany defunded three Palestinian human rights organizations that Israel had labeled as terrorist organizations in 2021. (These designations had been denounced by the United Nations.) The ministry told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in February that it regularly discussed this review with Israel. Some regional partners have issued their own boycotts against Germany. The Lebanon-based Haven for Artists collective rejected a $35,000 grant from the socialist Left Party\u2019s Rosa Luxemburg Foundation in January after a board member criticized Egypt for not admitting Palestinians fleeing Gaza, which the Lebanese group said amounted to support for ethnic cleansing. \u201cPeople within the [cultural] scene right now don\u2019t want to be associated with the German foundations,\u201d said a staffer at a German organization in Lebanon. The same source believes that more culture workers would join a boycott if they could afford to do so; many people who once saw Berlin as a hub of Arab culture, they added, have become disillusioned. In recent weeks, Germany, like the United States, has taken a harsher tone toward Israel. Scholz and Baerbock have now repeatedly called for a more permanent cease-fire and an increase in the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza to alleviate the risk of famine. They have also warned Netanyahu to cease Israel\u2019s planned full-scale invasion of Rafah. During a visit to Israel in mid-March, Scholz spoke not of Staatsraison, but of the suffering of Palestinians and the impossibility of fighting terrorism through military means alone. Still, in a scene unthinkable just months ago, Germany\u2019s chief representative in the Palestinian territories was chased out of Ramallah\u2019s Birzeit University in late April. Germany\u2019s rhetoric and actions since Oct. 7 \u201cdestroyed the dream and an idea of Germany,\u201d the staffer in Lebanon said. As one of the biggest Western funders of civil society in the Arab world, Germany will continue to be a major influence in the region. Its less political work, such as supporting infrastructure programs and providing language classes, has largely been unaffected by the Israel-Hamas war. But the government\u2019s moral advantage on many issues\u2014and Germany\u2019s image as a liberal, welcoming society\u2014may prove hard to rehabilitate. Update, June 3, 2024: The description of the incident at Birzeit University has been updated to reflect new reporting.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The announcement ramps up pressure on Israel and puts the United States in a new bind.",
                    "post_content": "The International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against top Israeli leaders and senior Hamas officials for alleged \u201cwar crimes and crimes against humanity\u201d committed during the ongoing war in Gaza, the court\u2019s top prosecutor announced on Monday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Yahya Sinwar, the most senior Hamas leader in Gaza, and two of the group\u2019s other top officials\u2014Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri and Ismail Haniyeh\u2014all now face the prospect of a formal international criminal arrest warrant. The ICC\u2019s top prosecutor, Karim Khan, will next file the docket of charges to a panel of ICC judges for review. The court\u2019s judges will then determine whether or not to issue the warrants. If approved, the warrants would mark the first time that the leader of a major U.S. international partner has faced ICC charges. The news swiftly led to a wave of criticism from the United States, Israel, and some in Europe against the ICC for what they argued equated Israeli leaders with the heads of a terrorist organization. U.S. President Joe Biden called the application \u201coutrageous.\u201d And U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted that the ICC had no jurisdiction over the case because neither side is party to the ICC, although the court has recognized\u00a0Palestine as a member party since 2014 and\u00a0ruled\u00a0in 2021 that it had jurisdiction over allegations of war crimes in Gaza. Blinken also said that by applying for arrest warrants for both top Israeli officials and Hamas, Khan was unfairly assigning moral equivalence between a U.S. ally and a terror group. By seeking a warrant now, Blinken argued, the ICC did not give Israel time to investigate the alleged crimes itself. \u201cWe reject the Prosecutor\u2019s equivalence of Israel with Hamas,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cIt is shameful.\u201d The ICC\u2019s \u201cproposal to issue an arrest warrant for the representatives of a democratically elected government together with the leaders of an Islamist terrorist organisation is appalling and completely unacceptable,\u201d Petr Fiala, the prime minister of the Czech Republic, said in a post on X. \u201cWe must not forget that it was Hamas that attacked Israel in October and killed, injured and kidnapped thousands of innocent people. It was this completely unprovoked terrorist attack that led to the current war in Gaza and the suffering of civilians in Gaza, Israel and Lebanon.\u201d In Washington, meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill that would sanction ICC officials seeking to prosecute Americans or the citizens of major U.S. allies and partners\u2014legislation that is unlikely to pass but which underscores the sharp new backlash that the ICC now faces in Washington. With regard to Netanyahu and Gallant, the ICC prosecutor\u2019s office stated that it has \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the two men \u201cbear criminal responsibility\u201d for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including using the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, denying humanitarian relief supplies, causing extermination, and deliberately targeting civilians amid Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza. For Sinwar and his Hamas lieutenants, the prosecutor\u2019s office similarly charges them with criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, taking hostages, rape, torture, and cruel treatment of hostages, and extermination since at least Oct. 7, 2023, the date of the major Hamas attack on Israel.\u00a0 \u201cIsrael, like all states, has the right to defend its population,\u201d Khan said in a recorded statement that was released by the court alongside a CNN interview. \u201cIt has every right to ensure the return of hostages that have been criminally and callously taken. Those rights, however, do not absolve Israel of its obligations to comply with international humanitarian law.\u201d \u201cIntentionally causing death, starvation, and injury, and suffering to the civilian population, including so very many women and children, are criminal means to achieve military and political goals. That\u2019s what we allege,\u201d Khan added. \u201cThose who do not comply with the law should not comply later when my office takes action based upon solid evidence.\u201d The decision could permanently damage the court\u2019s tenuous relationship with Washington regardless of whether the arrest warrants on Netanyahu and Gallant move forward, as Khan\u2019s announcement is likely to derail a careful but significant shift in U.S. policy toward the ICC under the Biden administration. Last year, Biden for the first time authorized the U.S. government to begin sharing evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine with the ICC\u2014overriding pushback from top U.S. defense officials who worried it could set a precedent for the court to one day prosecute U.S. troops. The Biden administration has also championed ICC investigations into the ongoing civil war in Sudan, including debating whether to share U.S. information with the ICC regarding atrocities and war crimes committed there. This shift on Ukraine marked a departure from decades of U.S. distrust and wariness over the international court\u2019s jurisdictions, with many successive administrations arguing that the court should not exercise any jurisdiction over citizens of countries that are not a party to the founding treaty that established the ICC. One hundred and twenty four countries are parties to the treaty, including many U.S. allies in Europe. The United States and Israel, as well as Russia, are not. Yet Biden\u2019s decision to back the ICC\u2019s prosecution efforts against Russia may put the United States in a new political bind and open it to new criticisms of double standards in its support for Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously extremely awkward because the Biden administration supported the arrest warrants against [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, and Russia is not a party to the ICC, and Putin is a head of state,\u201d said Adil Haque, a professor of law at Rutgers University. \u201cThe Biden administration has sort of forfeited some of their legal objections to charges against Israeli leaders.\u201d Haque added that the Biden administration might have a face-saving fallback position: to argue that Palestine isn\u2019t a state and therefore can\u2019t consent to ICC jurisdiction. But the move could also increase pressure on Israel at the United Nations. In addition to limiting travel for Netanyahu and Gallant to the 124 nations that are party to the ICC, it is likely to get certain U.N. member states such as South Africa\u2014which have asked the International Court of Justice to order Israel to allow investigators, journalists, and fact-finders into the Gaza Strip\u2014to ramp up their pressure campaign. \u201cIt will push Israel\u2014not just the people indicted, but Israel as a country\u2014most likely in a more of an isolated corner even than it already is,\u201d said Scott Anderson, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. Since the arrest warrants have yet to be issued, under the law, Israel can head off prosecutions of Netanyahu and Gallant by pursuing domestic criminal proceedings against the two men, potentially triggering a complementarity clause under the Rome Statute, which says that the ICC can\u2019t admit a case that\u2019s currently being investigated by a state that has jurisdiction over the charges. Other legal experts said that the charges, despite Western backlash, were a sign that international law is alive and well even at a time of intense upheaval in the Middle East. \u201cThere has been skepticism about whether international criminal law is going to live up to its aspirations and deliver equal justice under the law,\u201d said Haque. \u201cThe fact that these charges are being brought against both Hamas leaders and Israeli leaders, I think, is very significant.\u201d Update, May 20, 2024: This story has been updated to include comments from top Biden administration officials.",

                    "post_content": "Josep Borrell is in a reflective mood about Europe\u2019s role in the world\u2014a question whose answer he has spent the last four years shaping as the European Union\u2019s foreign-policy chief. And as Borrell does not plan to contest the EU\u2019s upcoming election next month, he\u2019ll be leaving his post at a time when that question is perhaps more salient than it has been for quite a while. Borrell is in Silicon Valley visiting tech leaders and Californian officials this week, a recognition of the growing importance of technology to geopolitics and Europe\u2019s efforts to avoid being left out of the conversation. After meeting with the tech and artificial intelligence giant Nvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, Borrell sat down with Foreign Policy at the company\u2019s headquarters to talk tech regulation, EU-U.S. relations, China, and the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. \u00a0This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Foreign Policy: What response have you gotten from the tech industry to European regulation efforts? Have you faced pushback? Josep Borrell: There has been a certain feeling that over-regulation can inhibit technological development and [that] one of the reasons why [Europe is] lagging behind is because of too much regulation. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think the problem is too much regulation, because if you look back 20 years ago, when the regulation was not there, we were already lagging behind.\u00a0 I think that it\u2019s a matter of how our ecosystem has been working. Lack of capital markets, a lack of understanding of the trends of technological development. Maybe we concentrated too much on the economic sectors and technological sectors of the past, and we haven\u2019t seen the new things coming, from electric cars to artificial intelligence. Now we discover that others have been investing and organizing much quicker in these key sectors of the future\u2014here in California and in China also.\u00a0 Europe can be in the middle of these two giants and we can become a kind of collateral damage of this competition. If [the United States] closes the door to the Chinese electric cars by putting a levy of 100 percent on them, then where will those Chinese cars go? They\u2019re going to go to other markets. Which are the other markets that could absorb this capacity? Well, it\u2019s Europe. FP: How have U.S. trade policies impacted Europe? JB: It is clear that the U.S. is pursuing a strong policy in order to create incentives and give financial support to the firms who are investing in the U.S. in order to develop the new technologies to fight climate change. And it\u2019s good for climate change. But it\u2019s clear that these incentives can attract firms to invest in the U.S. better than in Europe, because in the U.S. they have strong financial support and because energy is much cheaper in the U.S. than in Europe.\u00a0 So when we talk about leveling the playing field inside the [EU\u2019s] internal market, we also have to be worried about leveling the playing field with countries who are our friends but who, at the end, are also our competitors. FP: What has the response been when you\u2019ve conveyed these concerns to Washington? JB: The response is: \u201cYou believe that it\u2019s going to create an imbalance? [Then] do [what we\u2019re doing].\u201d\u00a0 The problem is that [the EU is] not a state\u2014we don\u2019t have a Pentagon, we don\u2019t have a treasury. And when you say, \u201cGive fiscal incentives,\u201d who is going to do it? We have 27 different fiscal systems, and we don\u2019t have a federal authority that could distribute these advantages. And if we do it at the level of each member state\u2014and member states will be more capable to do it because they have a stronger financial capacity\u2014then it is going to create an unlevel playing field inside our internal market. Here in the U.S., it\u2019s not Texas or Minnesota or Delaware who is doing this kind of fiscal incentive, it\u2019s the federation. But we are not a federation, so we don\u2019t have a central power that could disseminate these fiscal advantages for everybody around the union. So we cannot do the same thing. Here in the U.S., you are fighting against climate change by distributing financial support that creates jobs\u2014you\u2019re using the carrot. In Europe, we have been fighting against climate change by using prices or taxes\u2014a stick. Two different approaches. FP: How much alignment is there on China between Brussels and Washington, and within the EU itself? Chinese President Xi Jinping just visited Europe and chose to travel to three countries that are probably the most divergent from Brussels in their attitudes toward China: France, Serbia, and Hungary. JB: China has always tried to create a divide inside the European Union, trying to get closer to the eastern part of the European Union. But there are some member states, in particular Hungary, who are building a closer relationship with China than others, attracting Chinese investment and offering a much better political relationship. And the same thing can be said about Serbia, who is not a member [of the EU] yet but is a candidate. And it\u2019s clear that the way that Xi was received in Serbia shows a degree of political linkage, which is for sure different than he would have had in other countries. In France also he was very well received, but in France everybody knows that there is a big question about the competition on electric car production. But I think that we talk about two different things when you talk about the capacity of China to overflow us with cars. One thing is the excess capacity and another thing is the internal imbalance of the Chinese economy. The real problem is the structural imbalance of the Chinese economy, which makes internal demand weak with respect to production capacity, and the excess has to be evacuated or exported.\u00a0 So what China is doing is exporting to the rest of the world its internal imbalances. And to solve it, put in tariffs. The only thing that can be done is to transfer the product from one sector to another or from one market to another. The electric cars will not be sold in the U.S.; it will be [in] the rest of the European market [that they\u2019re sold]. And if you put the tariff in one sector, other sectors will pay the price. So the real problem that we have in our economic relationship with China is the internal imbalance of the Chinese economy, and this is something that is difficult to solve because it\u2019s a matter of policy. China is implementing two different policies which are complementary. One is shrinking internal demand to have export capacity and the second is focusing on critical sectors, the sectors they have identified as the future sectors. They did that with the solar panels, and now they\u2019re doing that with the car industry, investing massively in both.\u00a0 When they did that with the solar panels, they ruined our production capacity\u201480 percent of the solar panels that we are using in Europe are coming from China. I think the same thing happens in the U.S. And now the car industry, which is one of the hardcore parts of the industrial capacity in Europe, is under the same threat. FP: Do Brussels and Washington see eye to eye on the threat of China? JB: I think that we are allied, but we are not aligned. It doesn\u2019t mean that we are fighting each other, but in some cases it\u2019s clear that we have different interests. We are not equidistant\u2014we will always be closer to Washington than to Beijing. We share the same economic and political model. But it doesn\u2019t mean that 100 percent we agree on everything, because there are different approaches, different interests. With respect to our relationship with China on technology and trade, we should act in a better-coordinated manner. That\u2019s why we created the Trade and Technology Council. But at the end, [the Inflation Reduction Act] was presented by the U.S. without any kind of previous consultation, knowledge, and discussion with us. It was their own decision. In fact, it has a lot of consequences from the point of view of trade and technology with respect to us. And now, to put a levy of 100 percent on electric cars, it is also something that is decided by the U.S. without any kind of coordination with us.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s important because in this triangle, the side effects are important, and I don\u2019t think that the Europeans should be the adjustment variable of the confrontation between China and the U.S. At least, that\u2019s what we should try to avoid. FP: I wanted to ask about Ukraine\u2019s path toward EU membership. How is that going, and what does the road ahead look like? JB: The war has had consequences. One is the fact that today Ukraine is being granted the status of candidate state in a record time. For sure, without the war and without the very challenging situation in which Ukraine is, this would have taken much more time, if ever.\u00a0 But it shows a political will of supporting this country, because the strongest security commitment that we can offer to Ukraine without being a military alliance\u2014which we are not\u2014is membership. We can supply arms to fight the war, and the financial support that we do more than the U.S. You add up the total amount of money that we have been providing to Ukraine, it\u2019s about 96 billion [euros] already paid, which is more than the U.S. Certainly they are more concentrated on the military side than us, that is not the negligible sum, but the most important thing that we can offer to Ukraine is membership.\u00a0 This has been decided by unanimity because Ukraine is a country being attacked, we want to support Ukraine, and this should not be empty words. So Ukraine has to fight two battles at the same time\u2014the battle of rejecting the Russian aggression, which is something that has to be done in the battlefield, and the battle of reforms that they have to do in order to fulfill all the conditions to become a member. And they have to do it at the same time because accession is a merit-based process\u2014in order to become a member, you have to fulfill certain conditions. If we consider you a candidate, it means that we believe that you could fulfill these conditions, and we will support them in order to do it. FP: We saw the prolonged struggle to pass the latest aid package for Ukraine in the U.S., and as you said, Europe has given a lot of aid of its own. How much does that move the needle for the war effort? JB: Russia continues attacking Ukraine. In these last hours we have seen stronger attacks opening new fronts. Russia has massed 450,000 soldiers. At the beginning of the war it was 150,000. I don\u2019t see any intention on the Russian side to stop the war but [rather] to continue the war, and quickly, before the support that has been delayed for six months from the U.S. reaches the front line. So they are attacking quicker in order to take advantage of the relative weakness of the Ukrainians due to the fact that the U.S. support has been delayed, and even our support has not been as much as requested from the point of view of ammunition, for example.\u00a0 So I don\u2019t see Russia stopping the war. They will continue pushing, and we have to continue supporting Ukraine. And this six-month delay will not come without consequences on the front line. FP: On to the conflict in the Middle East, which you\u2019ve been vocal about. The U.N. General Assembly recently voted in favor of Palestine\u2019s membership bid, and multiple EU member states are set to officially recognize Palestine in the coming days. How will those actions impact the war in Gaza and global pressure on Israel? JB: It\u2019s clear that [while] we have been very united in front of Russia and its aggressions in Ukraine, we haven\u2019t been united in our position with respect to the war in Gaza. The first thing I have to say when we talk about the war in Gaza is that it started with a horrific terrorist attack [by] Hamas. I\u2019ve said many times that it was a horror that we condemn in the strongest possible terms, but one horror cannot justify another horror. Everybody from President [Joe] Biden, [U.S.] Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken, all the leaders of the European Union, is telling the Israeli authorities that there are too many people being killed [in Gaza]. My question is: How many are too many? Is 45,000 too many? What is the standard?\u00a0 And at the moment, everybody is asking [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu not to attack Rafah, because in Rafah there are hundreds of thousands of people that cannot escape and they cannot protect themselves from the war. Despite this request, it seems that Netanyahu\u2019s attacking Rafah, and we are all concerned by the degree of humanitarian catastrophe that this can produce. The problem is not to be concerned, but if you say something is unacceptable, it should not be accepted. So, what\u2019s happening now? What\u2019s next? FP: And how much of that is at the door of the U.S.? Do you think the U.S. is using all the leverage that it can over Israel? JB: I am not in a position to give advice to the U.S. But in 1982, when Israel was bombing Lebanon and Beirut, President [Ronald] Reagan decided to stop the supply of [U.S.] ammunition [to Israel], arguing that the number of civilian casualties was too high, and that it was unaffordable and unacceptable. He decided to stop the flow of munitions; they did. And in 1991, when Israel was reluctant to go to Madrid for the peace conference, [Washington] told the Israeli government: \u201cIf you don\u2019t go to Madrid to start the peace talks, I will cut your funding.\u201d So, there are leverages that have been used in the past. FP: Do you think that U.S. support for Israel has undermined the West\u2019s messaging on Ukraine to the global south? JB: One of the complaints that I am hearing more is criticism about double standards. This is a strong criticism all over the world, and [it] certainly affects the perception of people. I wonder what would happen if the Russian ambassador to the United Nations were to go up to the podium of the General Assembly and destroy the charter of the United Nations [as Israel\u2019s U.N. ambassador recently did]. I wonder what our reaction would have been. Certainly, we would not have been happy.\u00a0 And many people around the world complain that what Israel is doing in Gaza, we would not accept Russia doing in Ukraine. This creates the accusation of double standards, and we have to be very careful because we can lose our credibility. That\u2019s why we put pressure on Israel not to continue doing the military operation the way they have been doing, understanding very well their reaction to the terrorist attacks. For me, one horror doesn\u2019t justify another, and what\u2019s happening in Gaza is a horror. FP: Moving to the Indo-Pacific, is there much discussion in Brussels on the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan? What would the EU do if a conflict were to break out there? JB: We keep saying the same thing: We believe that we have to decrease tensions, we have to respect the statute of war, and we have to exclude any possibility of a military solution to the problem. Our fixed position is we don\u2019t recognize the statehood of Taiwan and we will not do it. It\u2019s one single China. It means that we are not going to recognize the statehood of Taiwan; we will have economic and cultural relations with this territory without recognition of statehood. And we call on everybody to understand that there is not a military solution to this problem. FP: You have said that Europe must \u201clearn to speak the language of power.\u201d What does that look like in practice? JB: It\u2019s difficult to give an example, but we Europeans have been developing a foreign policy mainly based on trade. Today, everything is becoming a weapon\u2014even trade has become a weapon. So we have to understand that we live in a more conflictual, a more transactional world in which you have to be able to say not only, \u201cPlease do it,\u201d but [also to] have some leverage. We certainly have leverage, but we have to have the political will of using it. Power is not only military power. Today, we talk about economic security, climate security, digital security. Everything can be understood from the security side, so everything can be used from the leverage side.\u00a0 FP: With the EU parliamentary election coming up, what are your hopes for Europe, and what should be the priorities for the next four years? JB: I am not running for this election, not even as a candidate to become a member of European Parliament. But I think that the feeling is that Europeans have to be more responsible. I don\u2019t want to talk about strategic autonomy; I want to talk about strategic responsibility\u2014to be aware of the challenges of the world and to make European citizens aware that, yes, we make peace among us, but peace is not the natural state of things. The whole world is suffering wars. And now the war is on our borders, and we have to be able to face a situation in which we should react. For that, you have to have the capacity, and it\u2019s clear that we don\u2019t have it.",

                    "post_content": "Emma Ashford: Hi, Matt, how is your week going? It\u2019s the end of the semester, and I\u2019m sure things on campus must be peaceful and tranquil as the students prepare for their exams. Matt Kroenig: I assume that is sarcasm? Things have actually been pretty quiet at Georgetown, but campuses across the United States have been rocked by protests against Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. EA: You got me; it\u2019s sarcasm. I haven\u2019t seen protests this widespread on a foreign-policy issue since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Encampments are springing up on university campuses across the United States, leaving administrators scrambling to figure out how they can both manage the students and appease their donors. In a few places\u2014most notably at Columbia University in New York City\u2014the university administration called in the cops to clear out their students, even though the protests were largely peaceful. It all seems to be a huge overreaction to some pretty milquetoast civil disobedience. MK: Well, as usual, you and I see this differently. The problem is that administrators at Columbia and other places badly mismanaged things before it got to this point. The principles at stake are simple: Universities should permit free speech; and they should enforce policies to keep campus open for all students, especially those who want to learn, go to class, and study for exams\u2014which, after all, is the primary mission of a university. It was a mistake for Columbia to negotiate with a loud, disorderly minority over long-held university policies, like prohibitions against students building encampments on campus. Administrators, like Ben Sasse at the University of Florida, who simply upheld university policy from the start, including suspending students who violated the rules by setting up anti-Israel camps, provided a much better example of effective university leadership. EA: Well, first, I think it\u2019s a mistake to lump together all the different protests. At UCLA, a small minority of students apparently set up barricades or were arrested for carrying materials to build them. There was also violence instigated by pro-Israel counterprotesters, who tried to dismantle the encampment there. At Columbia, some of the protesters occupied an administrative building. The former is clearly a problem; as you point out, it prevents other students from learning and accessing classes. It isn\u2019t speech; it\u2019s a barricade. The latter is clearly against university policies and is civil disobedience, although it\u2019s not uncommon for students to occupy academic buildings during protests, usually with limited repercussions. At Columbia, too, protesters were likely trying to draw parallels to prior occupation of the same building by anti-Vietnam War demonstrators back in 1968. But at a variety of other schools, these protests were entirely peaceful, didn\u2019t disrupt classes, and yet were still broken up by police. I\u2019m particularly ashamed of my own alma mater, the University of Virginia (UVA). As the local Charlottesville newspaper the Daily Progress described it, \u201cDays of quiet, peaceful protest came to a chaotic and violent end Saturday afternoon as Virginia State Police stormed an encampment of anti-war protesters at the University of Virginia.\u201d The only reason these students were even violating university policy was that the policy was quietly changed over the weekend to end an exemption allowing \u201crecreational tents.\u201d It\u2019s utterly ridiculous. Students have a First Amendment right to protest peacefully, just like everyone else. MK: The New York Times reports that the protesters at UVA were violating policy by, among other things, using megaphones. That sounds like a sensible policy to me. It is hard to study\u2014which, after all, is the main point of a university\u2014when fellow students are causing a ruckus outside. Moreover, I am not sure these protests really represent meaningful \u201cfree speech.\u201d When I started at Georgetown, a faculty mentor taught me never to underestimate our undergraduate students\u2019 intelligence, but never overestimate their knowledge. He was right. These protesters are in their late teens and early 20s. They don\u2019t really understand what they are talking about\u2014I certainly did not at their age. If they put down their megaphones and engaged in curious intellectual debate with others, they might actually learn something. EA: I was pretty dumb at that age, too. But I think you\u2019re doing these young men and women a disservice by implying they don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re talking about. Maybe they don\u2019t know all the ins and outs of the Israel-Palestine situation. Perhaps they don\u2019t know who Arthur James Balfour was, or about the Nakba, or the domestic politics of Israel. But they are protesting the violence and cruelty that they see on the news, and I think it\u2019s laudable that they are willing to do that when it doesn\u2019t directly impact them. And let\u2019s be honest, Israel remains a hot-button topic, and one where there\u2019s a lot of pressure from big donors on university administrators. That\u2019s why these encampments are being treated as anything more than a nuisance. If these students were protesting in support of the Uyghurs in China or for women\u2019s rights in Iran, the crackdown wouldn\u2019t be nearly so bad. Honestly, Matt, if these were anti-regime protesters on the streets of Tehran, you\u2019d be applauding them and probably arguing for U.S. support! MK: So we are comparing American college students, blessed with First Amendment rights but who choose to engage in disorderly conduct that infringes on the rights of others, to genuinely oppressed people demanding basic human rights from an evil, autocratic regime? My head hurts just trying to disentangle the analogy. Let me turn it around. Why are there not disorderly protests against egregious violations of international humanitarian law, like China\u2019s genocide against the Uyghurs, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s labor camps, or Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s abduction of Ukrainian children? Instead, the only disorderly protests are against a U.S. democratic partner fighting a violent terrorist group. It again reveals that these students don\u2019t really understand the issues, and they seem to be motivated by something other than universal justice. EA: Well, I\u2019d say the reason that students aren\u2019t protesting those other conflicts is that the U.S. government isn\u2019t arming China and North Korea or funding Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Congress just sent Israel another $17 billion, and Washington acts as a shield for its actions at the United Nations. This is Americans\u2019 war, too, and although I understand why Israel felt it had to go into Gaza after the horror of the Hamas attack in October last year, I\u2019m still utterly appalled that the U.S. government is supporting what is becoming an open slaughter of much of the population of the Gaza Strip. MK: That doesn\u2019t fully hold up. The United States government could be doing more to counter China\u2019s genocide and stop Putin\u2019s war crimes in Ukraine. Why not protest the inaction? The answer is, in part, that an unhealthy fixation on Israel, antisemitism, and anti-Americanism are pathologies of left-wing activism. Still, putting the merit of the protests aside, they are already having a political effect. Many progressives sympathize with the protesters, while many conservatives just see chaos. President Joe Biden is in a tough spot as he doesn\u2019t want to be seen as supporting a crackdown on peaceful protesters, but he also doesn\u2019t want this to become a \u201claw and order\u201d election, which tend to benefit conservatives. Recall that anti-Vietnam riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention were a major factor propelling Richard Nixon to victory in the presidential election that fall. EA: You might be right on that point. Conservative media is already treating these protests as a rerun of the Black Lives Matter protests, some of which turned violent back in 2020, providing footage later used in campaign ads for former President Donald Trump. Perhaps the bigger problem is that no one is trying to defuse this situation. Biden appears largely unwilling to criticize Israel, though his recent steps toward withholding arms supplies from Israel if they continue into Rafah are promising. But it\u2019s probably more relevant that campus administrators across the country are simply calling in the police rather than engaging with the protesters at all. In the places where they did engage the protesters\u2014for example, at Brown and Rutgers\u2014things have mostly ended peacefully. It\u2019s worth thinking about what the protesters are actually trying to do here. As our fellow FP columnist Adam Tooze pointed out in his podcast episode on the crisis at Columbia, protesters are mostly trying to raise the salience of the issue and force their universities to take a stand. MK: That is the problem. Universities should not take a stand on the Israel-Hamas war, or any other political matter disconnected from their core missions of research and teaching. Universities can\u2019t simultaneously be forums for free speech and at the same time take an official stand on one side of the debate. They should practice institutional neutrality. EA: Top universities are elite institutions and run massive endowments more akin to the wealth of top hedge funds. They are more than mere education institutions, as much as I might wish it were otherwise; they make investments with those endowments, hence the calls for divestment from companies linked to Israel. I personally think it would be smarter for protesters to be targeting the Biden administration directly, but you can\u2019t deny that the universities are public actors. Anyway, perhaps it\u2019s time we talked about the conflict itself? Things have gotten even worse on the ground since we last debated this. We seem to have avoided regional escalation with Iran, but the Israelis have now begun operations in Rafah, the last big population center in the Gaza Strip, and one that currently houses hundreds of thousands of refugees displaced by prior operations farther north. The scope of the operations remains unclear, but Israel has instructed refugees to leave the area. The Biden administration, in response, has paused one arms shipment and threatened to withhold further deliveries of bombs and artillery shells if Israel enters Rafah\u2019s most populated areas. MK: The suffering of the Palestinian people is tragic. But Israel needs to go into Rafah to achieve its stated war aims of eliminating Hamas. EA: Again, I\u2019ll refer you to our column several months back, when we discussed whether that aim is even achievable. I\u2019m sure there are still Hamas militants in Rafah\u2014reportedly several battalions\u2019 worth\u2014but whether you can destroy them without also killing most of the civilians is an open question. And, obviously, that won\u2019t destroy Hamas\u2019s leadership or ideology. MK: We\u2019ve debated this before, and I still disagree. Capturing or killing every Hamas militant in Gaza would be a victory for Israel and a defeat for Hamas. Even Hamas seems to agree, or it wouldn\u2019t be insisting on a cessation of hostilities as part of a hostage deal. But the war continues. Israel has begun a limited military operation in Rafah. So, it seems that it is trying to thread the needle of eliminating Hamas, while limiting civilian casualties and the corresponding international pressure. We will see if it works. EA: Two things here. First, it\u2019s interesting that you mention negotiations, because by all accounts, Hamas has accepted an agreement that would free some more hostages in exchange for a pause in hostilities, eventually leading to a permanent cessation. Israeli leaders seem opposed to it, though they\u2019re still considering it. But second, it\u2019s impossible to see how one could mount even a limited operation in an environment like Rafah without killing significant numbers of civilians. The Israelis just took control of the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which had been the only remaining way out of the strip for civilians. They\u2019re also reportedly preventing civilians from returning to homes in the north. So what are civilians in that situation meant to do? They\u2019ve been moved from area to area for six months, with the constant threat of bombing and raids, insufficient food and medical care, and no proper facilities. Now tens of thousands of Gazans are being instructed to evacuate to a small tent camp outside the city that isn\u2019t remotely sufficient to support them. Israel is just not taking adequate care to protect civilians here. Biden is right to withhold arms\u2014at a minimum, until the Israelis find a better plan. MK: Hamas\u2019s proposal, as you point out, requires a permanent cessation of hostilities. In other words, it wants the war to end so it can continue to rule over Gaza and go on to attack Israel another day. That is unacceptable to Israel because it is contrary to its goal of eliminating Hamas. I agree that the suffering of the Palestinian civilians is heartbreaking. But the fault lies exclusively with Hamas. It could surrender immediately and zero additional Palestinians would perish. But it clearly doesn\u2019t care about the Palestinians. Instead, innocent Palestinians are a tool in the group\u2019s genocidal plans to wipe Israel off the map. Hamas chooses to continue to fight Israel, using civilians as shields. The Israelis have gone to great lengths to minimize civilian casualties, but they are at war, and their understandable goals are to defeat the enemy, while also following the law of armed conflict. There were some theoretical alternatives. Egypt could have created a refugee camp in the Sinai Peninsula, for example, but Cairo did not want to deal with the Palestinian issue, either. If you have the ideal solution, I would love to hear it. EA: I don\u2019t have a good solution. There are no good solutions here. But it worries me a lot that many of these proposed solutions are in practice war crimes. Displacing the Palestinians into Egypt, for example, is ethnic cleansing. And given the experience of Lebanon and particularly Jordan with Palestinian refugees in the past, I can\u2019t blame the Egyptians for saying no to that. Blaming Hamas for civilian deaths? Morally, you may be correct. But there\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t say that civilians whose governments don\u2019t surrender are complicit (also a war crime!). What if Putin suddenly announced that because the government in Kyiv didn\u2019t surrender to him, Russian forces would do their best to avoid civilian casualties but were ultimately justified in killing any unfortunate Ukrainian civilians who happened to be in the way? Would Putin be abiding by the law of armed conflict in that case? Of course not! So why is Israel given this leeway? MK: I reject your comparison. Israel is following the law of armed conflict and going to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Putin is purposely targeting Ukrainian civilians. As you know, international law does not require zero civilian deaths in war. It requires following the principles of distinction and proportionality, which Israel is doing and Putin is not. EA: I fully acknowledge that Israel is operating under difficult circumstances in Gaza. But Washington should not encourage or condone it violating these norms of conflict, unless the U.S. government wants others to start doing the same. This conflict is already doing a lot of reputational damage to the U.S., as countries rightly call the Biden administration hypocritical for focusing on atrocities in Ukraine or Syria, but aiding and abetting them in Gaza. Who\u2019s going to take U.S. calls to push back on China arming Russia seriously when we do the same for Israel? MK: The United States can and should stand on the side of both Israel and international law, by backing Israel\u2019s legitimate war aims, so long as Israel continues to follow the law of armed conflict. EA: You know as well as I do that you could drive a truck through the \u201cproportionality\u201d loophole in the law of armed conflict. Israel may say that it is considering civilian casualties in its decision-making process, but the numbers of dead suggest that might not be accurate. I\u2019m also extremely concerned about reports that Israel is using AI targeting, and that there might be evidence of potential mass killings in Gaza. I still think the reputational risk to the United States\u2014not to mention the domestic unrest\u2014for backing Israel further is pretty severe. That\u2019s especially true if Israel rejects a reasonable cease-fire deal in the coming days and weeks. But before we wrap up, there have been a few developments in Ukraine that I wanted to mention. You may recall arguing, when we last debated the topic of Ukraine, that escalation risks in the conflict are overblown. But this week, we saw several indicators that Russia is escalating\u2014reports of planned sabotage of weapons production in Western Europe, and military drills that simulate nuclear use. Both suggest that Russia is escalating in response to Western steps to send, for example, long-range weapons to Ukraine. MK: The nuclear threats are largely a bluff at this stage. Putin has learned that when he says \u201cnukes,\u201d the West says that it fears \u201cescalation\u201d and then restrains its war effort. You\u2019re right that Putin wants the West to curtail aid to Ukraine, but he is not literally going nuclear over it. EA: So he\u2019ll just set some German factories on fire? It doesn\u2019t have to be nuclear to be a problem. But I suspect that Ukraine will continue to lose media attention as the war in Gaza grinds on. That\u2019s bad for the Ukrainians\u2014and probably bad for Biden. The longer the war in Gaza remains in the spotlight, the worse it looks for his reelection chances. The U.S. public remains broadly pro-Israel, but Arab Americans are clearly turning against Biden on this issue. One recent poll found that Arab American support for Biden had dropped from 59 percent in 2020 to just 17 percent today. In swing states like Michigan, that could be a problem for his campaign. MK: Well, at least the media attention on the protesters is likely to die down. The semester is almost over and one thing kids care about more than cheugy Gaza protests is slaying a totally lit summer break. Speaking of which, I look forward to a poppin\u2019 time away from campus\u2014once I finish this cringy grading. EA: Oh, why did you remind me? There\u2019s something we do agree on: Grading papers is the worst. Maybe I\u2019ll go join a protest encampment instead.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Washington is wrong to accept the court\u2019s indictment of Russian, but not Israeli, leaders.\r\n",
                    "post_content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fears that the International Criminal Court (ICC) will soon charge him for alleged war crimes in Gaza and has appealed to the Biden administration for help. Washington is reportedly trying to dissuade ICC chief Prosecutor Karim Khan from filing charges, but its arguments, both legal and practical, are weak. Khan has not said what he is planning, but the most likely charges will be for obstructing access to food and other humanitarian aid. Khan has already warned the Netanyahu government that this reported obstruction could lead to ICC action, and given Israel\u2019s refusal to allow the court\u2019s investigators into Gaza, the proof of obstruction\u2014in the form of widely acknowledged famine conditions\u2014is more readily available than evidence concerning Israel\u2019s indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing of Palestinian civilians. Senior officials in Hamas\u2019s military chain of command are also likely to face charges for the atrocities that the group committed on Oct. 7, 2023. The Israeli government claims that it has not restricted the flow of aid, but this denial of Netanyahu\u2019s starvation strategy is not credible, given the extensive reporting on the needless obstacles that Israeli officials have erected to humanitarian aid entering Gaza. \u00a0Instead, the Netanyahu government has responded to the possibility of ICC charges with threats, saying it would retaliate against the Palestinian Authority, potentially leading to its collapse. That threat has a shoot-yourself-in-the-foot quality, given the PA\u2019s service to Israel in helping to keep the lid on an endlessly occupied population in the West Bank. But it also shows Israel\u2019s unwillingness to seriously grapple with the charges. If there were a conscientious domestic prosecutorial effort to hold those obstructing aid accountable, the ICC would be required to defer to it under its principle of complementarity. The Biden administration\u2019s response has been no better. Rather than recognize that the ICC represents an independent effort to uphold the international rule of law in the much-touted \u201crules-based order,\u201d a spokesperson for the administration claimed that the court did not have jurisdiction. That is an allusion to the long-standing U.S. opposition to the ICC exercising jurisdiction over the nationals of governments that have not joined the court, even if their alleged crimes were committed on the territory of a government that is a court member. But Washington\u2019s objections to such territorial jurisdiction were overruled by the governments that created the court in Rome more than two decades ago. And the U.S. government effectively abandoned that argument as well after the ICC used territorial jurisdiction in March 2023 to charge Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes in Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden said those charges were \u201cjustified,\u201d and the U.S. Senate unanimously agreed. That makes sense, because it is an essential attribute of sovereignty to address crimes on a nation\u2019s territory regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator. Palestine, as a recognized U.N. observer state, has conferred jurisdiction to the ICC, and the court\u2019s judges have approved Khan\u2019s investigation. Given the weakness of the jurisdictional argument, the administration is reportedly falling back on supposedly pragmatic appeals. \u201cWe are quietly encouraging the ICC not to do it. It will blow up everything,\u201d a U.S. official told Axios. This is the latest variation of the old argument that justice impedes peace\u2014which implies that a leader facing criminal charges is more likely to keep fighting than to accept the need for a settlement. But history shows that charges for war crimes often facilitate peace efforts by marginalizing an abusive leader. For example, in his book To End a War, the former U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke made clear that the Dayton Peace Agreement resolving the Bosnian conflict of the 1990s was possible only because the International Criminal Tribunal for the former nation of Yugoslavia had already charged the Bosnian Serb military and political leaders, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, precluding their travel to Dayton without risking arrest. Holbrooke made his remarkable deal with the Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, who had not yet been charged. Charges against former Liberian President Charles Taylor, issued by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, led to his rapid loss of power and paved the way for the brutal Liberian conflict to end and a strong democracy to emerge. ICC charges against the leaders of the Uganda-based Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, which was notorious for kidnapping children and making them become soldiers, forced the leaders into hiding, the organization to splinter, and its military presence to weaken substantially. ICC charges against Netanyahu could have a similar salutary effect. Today, Netanyahu is a major obstacle to a lasting cease-fire in Gaza. He has been taking extreme positions because he is beholden to two far-right ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, if he hopes to stay in power and avoid possible prison time on corruption charges that predate the current conflict. As a result, Netanyahu has undermined a key incentive for Hamas to agree to a cease-fire deal by saying that he would invade Rafah, the southern Gaza city where 1.4 million Palestinian civilians are sheltering, \u201cwith or without a deal.\u201d Taking that threat a step further, his government has ordered Palestinians to evacuate eastern Rafah, and Israeli troops have taken control of the city\u2019s border crossing with Egypt. Similarly, Netanyahu has ruled out the establishment of a Palestinian state, let alone equal rights within the existing \u201cone-state reality\u201d between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, leaving Palestinians with the unpalatable options of ongoing apartheid or mass expulsion. There is no way to know how the Israeli public will respond to potential ICC charges against Netanyahu, but they are likely to underscore that his prioritization of his own power and future has become a profound liability for Israel. That would make it more likely for Israelis to usher in a government that is more open to the kinds of difficult compromises needed to free the hostages, end the bloodshed in Gaza, and remove the perennial threat of armed conflict that has so destabilized the region. As it did for the alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, the Biden administration should stand aside and let the ICC process run its course.",

                    "post_excerpt": "A former ICC president answers questions about the top court's jurisdiction in the Israel-Hamas war.",
                    "post_content": "In the weeks following Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year, the top prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, repeatedly warned those engaged in the war to proceed with extreme care\u2014specifically cautioning against using starvation as a weapon of war. Six months on, with Gaza experiencing a \u201cfull-blown famine\u201d and more than 75 percent of its population displaced, the Israeli and international media are abuzz with news about the ICC potentially issuing arrest warrants against senior Israeli officials\u2014including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cIsrael expects the leaders of the free world to stand firmly against the ICC[\u2019s] outrageous assault on Israel\u2019s inherent right of self-defense,\u201d Netanyahu said in a video statement last week. Though many, including in the U.S. government and media, have questioned the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction and called on the court to back down, the ICC is entitled to adjudicate on the legality of both Israel\u2019s and Hamas\u2019s conduct in the war. Here is why. What is the ICC? Established in 2002, the ICC is an international court that has the ability to prosecute individuals accused of criminal conduct including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression. Unlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is also based at The Hague and adjudicates the responsibility of states, the ICC does not indict a state or a people. In his video statement last week, Netanyahu said the ICC arrest warrants would \u201cput Israel in the dock.\u201d This view is wrong. ICC prosecutions are limited to questions of accountability of individuals for their own conduct alleged as crimes. The ICC will not indict the state of Israel or its citizenry. Does the ICC have jurisdiction over Israeli nationals? The ICC can prosecute nationals of a state that is party to the Rome Statute. It can also prosecute crimes committed on the territory of a state that is party to the treaty whether or not the defendant\u2019s state is party to the Rome Statute. Even though Israel is not a party to the treaty, Palestine is a member state. Thus, the ICC can prosecute Israeli officials for complicity in crimes that Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers allegedly committed on Palestinian territory. Conversely, the court has jurisdiction over individual members of Hamas (as Palestinian nationals) for the international crimes they allegedly committed in Israel as well. The same legal principle has been used in the case of Russia, which is not a party to the Rome Statue. In 2022, a group of 39 countries, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, called on the ICC to investigate the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This resulted in the ICC issuing an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin for committing war crimes on Ukrainian territory\u2014a move that was applauded by U.S. President Joe Biden. Thus, it would be contradictory for any of these states to accept the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction over Russian nationals but not those of Israel. Why is this controversial? On the eve of his appointment as the United States\u2019 chief prosecutor for the Nuremberg trials, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson said, \u201cWe cannot successfully cooperate with the rest of the world in establishing a reign of law unless we are prepared to have that law sometimes operate against what would be our national advantage.\u201d This is a rule of good faith that must guide attitudes toward the world\u2019s top courts. In inquiring into a charge, the ICC singularly focuses on whether the defendant is guilty of the crime as charged according to international law. That inquiry is devoid of politics\u2014or political interference. It is regrettable that some states have been unwilling to support the court\u2014notably in the execution of arrest warrants\u2014when their friends and allies are concerned. For example, many African and Middle Eastern governments, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jordan, Malawi, Nigeria, and South Africa, failed to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he traveled to their countries. This has left many of the court\u2019s arrests warrants unexecuted. In some instances, member states such as Canada, Germany, Nigeria, and the U.K. have made public statements in support of their political allies in situations before the court, notwithstanding that such statements are purely political and tend to undermine the global perception of the court. What would an ICC indictment mean? Though it remains unconfirmed, it is likely that any ICC arrest warrant against Israeli officials would include the charge of the use of starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza, given the utterances of Israeli officials themselves and the obstruction of food and aid that have been widely decried by many. However, arrest warrants and indictments do not mean that the persons charged are guilty of the crimes. While an ICC inquiry is ongoing, the defendant will enjoy the presumption of innocence throughout and will be afforded every opportunity to defend themselves. At the end of the trial, the three judges will decide\u2014by majority\u2014whether the evidence the prosecutor marshaled against the defendant satisfied the required standard of proof for conviction. And that bar is very high. While there have been many cases at the ICC where the judges convicted the defendants because that high standard of proof was met, there have also been cases in which ICC judges have acquitted defendants at the end of their trials or appeals. Notable examples include former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo and one of his ministers, Charles Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9, who were acquitted at their trial. The conviction of Jean-Pierre Bemba, a former Congolese senator and vice president, was overturned on appeal. Ultimately, the question turns to what arrest warrants would mean, in the meantime, for Israeli officials. Based on the ICC\u2019s previous experience, it would not mean an immediate arrest and trial. Bashir has still not been arrested or tried, even though his arrest warrant was issued in 2009. For a long time, before he was deposed, he kept traveling to friendly states that did not arrest him. Their argument was that customary international law recognized immunity for him as a head of state. But finally in 2019, the ICC Appeals Chamber stated clearly that no such immunity existed in relation to cases before international tribunals, especially the ICC. Thus, the immediate problem for Israeli officials under any ICC arrest warrant would be that the court\u2019s 124 member states would be under a legal obligation to arrest such officials if they traveled to any of those 124 countries. That obligation should not be underestimated\u2014just last year, Putin canceled his plans to attend the BRICS summit in South Africa, in the apparent light of Pretoria\u2019s obligation to arrest him.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The Israeli military\u2019s algorithmic targeting has created dangerous new precedents.",
                    "post_content": "Investigative journalism published in April by Israeli media outlet Local Call (and its English version, +972 Magazine) shows that the Israeli military has established a mass assassination program of unprecedented size, blending algorithmic targeting with a high tolerance for bystander deaths and injuries. The investigation reveals a huge expansion of Israel\u2019s previous targeted killing practices, and it goes a long way toward explaining how and why the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) could kill so many Palestinians while still claiming to adhere to international humanitarian law. It also represents a dangerous new horizon in human-machine interaction in conflict\u2014a trend that\u2019s not limited to Israel. Israel has a long history of using targeted killings. During the violent years of the Second Intifada (2000-2005), it became institutionalized as a military practice, but operations were relatively infrequent and often involved the use of special munitions or strikes that targeted only people in vehicles to limit damage to bystanders. But since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, the IDF has shifted gears. It has discarded the old process of careful target selection of mid-to-high-ranking militant commanders. Instead, it has built on ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including for locating targets. The new system automatically sifts through huge amounts of raw data to identify probable targets and hand their names to human analysts to do with what they will\u2014and in most cases, it seems, those human analysts recommend an airstrike. The new process, according to the investigation by Local Call and +972 Magazine, works like this: An AI-driven system called Lavender has tracked the names of nearly every person in Gaza, and it combines a wide range of intelligence inputs\u2014from video feeds and intercepted chat messages to social media data and simple social network analysis\u2014to assess the probability that an individual is a combatant for Hamas or another Palestinian militant group. It was up to the IDF to determine the rate of error that it was willing to tolerate in accepting targets flagged by Lavender, and for much of the war, that threshold has apparently been 10 percent. Targets that met or exceeded that threshold would be passed on to operations teams after a human analyst spent an estimated 20 seconds to review them. Often this involved only checking whether a given name was that of a man (on the assumption that women are not combatants). Strikes on the 10 percent of false positives\u2014comprising, for example, people with similar names to Hamas members or those sharing phones with family members identified as Hamas members\u2014were deemed an acceptable error under wartime conditions. A second system, called Where\u2019s Dad, determines whether targets are at their homes. Local Call reported that the IDF prefers to strike targets at their homes because it is much easier to find them there than it is while they engage the IDF in battle. The families and neighbors of those possible Hamas members are viewed as insignificant collateral damage, and many of these strikes have so far been directed at what one of the Israeli intelligence officers interviewed called \u201cunimportant people\u201d\u2014junior Hamas members who are seen as legitimate targets because they are combatants but not of great strategic significance. This appears to have especially been the case during the early crescendo of bombardment at the outset of the war, after which the focus shifted towards somewhat more senior targets \u201cso as not to waste bombs\u201d. One lesson from this revelation addresses the question of whether Israel\u2019s tactics in Gaza are genocidal. Genocidal acts can include efforts to bring about mass death through deliberately induced famine or the wholesale destruction of the infrastructure necessary to support future community life, and some observers have claimed that both are evident in Gaza. But the clearest example of genocidal conduct is opening fire on civilians with the intention of wiping them out en masse. Despite evident incitement to genocide by Israeli officials not linked to the IDF\u2019s chain of command, the way that the IDF has selected and struck targets has remained opaque. Local Call and +972 Magazine have shown that the IDF may be criminally negligent in its willingness to strike targets when the risk of bystanders dying is very high, but because the targets selected by Lavender are ostensibly combatants, the IDF\u2019s airstrikes are not intended to exterminate a civilian population. They have followed the so-called operational logic of targeted killing even if their execution has resembled saturation bombing in its effects. This matters to experts in international law and military ethics because of the doctrine of double effect, which permits foreseeable but unintended harms if the intended act does not depend on those harms occurring, such as in the case of an airstrike against a legitimate target that would happen whether or not there were bystanders. But in the case of the Israel-Hamas war, most lawyers and ethicists\u2014and apparently some number of IDF officers\u2014see these strikes as failing to meet any reasonable standard of proportionality while stretching the notion of discrimination beyond reasonable interpretations. In other words, they may still be war crimes. Scholars and practitioners have discussed \u201chuman-machine teaming\u201d as a way to conceptualize the growing centrality of interaction between AI-powered systems and their operators during military actions. Rather than autonomous \u201ckiller robots,\u201d human-machine teaming envisions the next generation of combatants to be systems that distribute agency between human and machine decision-makers. What emerges is not The Terminator, but a constellation of tools brought together by algorithms and placed in the hands of people who still exercise judgment on their use. Algorithmic targeting is in widespread use in the Chinese province of Xinjiang, where the Chinese government employs something similar as a means of identifying suspected dissidents among the Uyghur population. In both Xinjiang and the occupied Palestinian territories, the algorithms that incriminate individuals depend on a wealth of data inputs that are unavailable outside of zones saturated with sensors and subject to massive collection efforts. Ukraine also uses AI-powered analysis to identify vulnerabilities along the vast front line of battle, where possible Russian military targets are more plentiful than Ukrainian supplies of bombs, drones, and artillery shells. But it does so in the face of some level of skepticism from military intelligence personnel, who worry that this stifles operational creativity and thoughtfulness\u2014two crucial weapons that Ukraine wields in its David-versus-Goliath struggle against Russia. During its \u201cwar on terror,\u201d the United States\u2019 \u2018signature strikes\u2019 employed a more primitive form of algorithmic target selection, with pilots determining when to strike based on computer-assisted assessments of suspicious behavior on the ground. Notably, this practice quickly became controversial for its high rates of bystander deaths. But Israel\u2019s use of Lavender, Where\u2019s Dad, and other previously exposed algorithmic targeting systems\u2014such as the Gospel\u2014shows how human-machine teaming can become a recipe for strategic and moral disaster. Local Call and +972 published testimonies from a range of intelligence officers suggesting growing discomfort, at all levels of the IDF\u2019s chain of command, with the readiness of commanders to strike targets with no apparent regard to bystanders. Israel\u2019s policies violate emerging norms of responsible AI use. They mix an emotional atmosphere of emergency and fury within the IDF, a deterioration in operational discipline, and a readiness to outsource regulatory compliance to a machine in the name of efficiency. Together, these factors show how an algorithmic system has the potential to become an \u201cunaccountability machine,\u201d allowing the IDF to transform military norms not through any specific set of decisions, but by systematically attributing new, unrestrained actions to a seemingly objective computer. How did this happen? Israel\u2019s political leadership assigned the IDF an impossible goal: the total destruction of Hamas. At the outset of the war, Hamas had an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 fighters. After almost two decades of control in the Gaza Strip, Hamas was everywhere. On Oct. 7, Hamas fighters posed a terrible threat to any IDF ground force entering Gaza unless their numbers could be depleted and their battalions scattered or forced underground. The fact that Lavender could generate a nearly endless list of targets\u2014and that other supporting systems could link them to buildings that could be struck rapidly from the air and recommend appropriate munitions\u2014gave the IDF an apparent means of clearing the way for an eventual ground operation. Nearly half of reported Palestinian fatalities occurred during the initial six weeks of heavy bombing. Human-machine teaming, in this case, produced a replicable tactical solution to a strategic problem. The IDF overcame the main obstacle to this so-called solution,\u2014the vast number of innocent civilians densely packed into the small territory of the Gaza Strip\u2014by simply deciding not to care all that much whom it killed alongside its targets. In strikes against senior Hamas commanders, according to the Local Call and +972 investigation, those interviewed said the IDF decided it was permissible to kill as many as \u201chundreds\u201d of bystanders for each commander killed; for junior Hamas fighters, that accepted number began at 15 bystanders but shifted slightly down and up during various phases of fighting. Moreover, as targets were frequently struck in homes where unknown numbers of people were sheltering, entire families were wiped out. These family annihilations likely grew as additional relatives or unrelated people joined the original residents to temporarily shelter, and it does not seem that the IDF\u2019s intelligence personnel typically attempted to discover this and update their operational decisions accordingly. Although Israel often presents the IDF as being in exemplary conformance to liberal and Western norms, the way that the IDF has used AI in Gaza, according to the Local Call and +972, is in stark contrast to those same norms. In U.S. military doctrine, all strikes must strive to keep bystander deaths below the determined \u201cnon-combatant casualty cut-off value\u201d (NCV). NCVs for most U.S. operations have been very low, and historically, so have Israel\u2019s\u2014at least when it comes to targeted killing. For example, when Hamas commander Salah Shehadeh was killed along with 14 others in an Israeli airstrike in 2002, then-IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Yaalon said that he would not have allowed the operation to happen if he\u2019d known it would kill that many others. In interviews over the years, other Israeli officials involved in the operation similarly stated that the high number of bystander deaths was a major error. Local Call and +972 revealed that, by contrast, the assassination of Hamas battalion commander Wissam Farhat during the current Israel-Hamas war had an NCV of more than 100 people\u2014and that the IDF anticipated that it would kill around that many. Israeli military officers interviewed by Local Call and +972 explained that this shift was made possible by the supposed objectivity of AI and a mindset that emphasized action over judgment. The IDF has embraced a wartime logic, by which it accepts a higher rate of \u201cerrors\u201d in exchange for tactical effectiveness while its commanders desire for vengeance against Hamas. In successive operations in 2008, 2012, and 2014\u2014famously termed \u201cmowing the grass\u201d by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett\u2014Israel has periodically dropped nonprecision munitions in significant numbers on buildings and tunnel systems deemed to be Hamas targets. Combatant-to-noncombatant fatalities in these wars ranged between 1-to-1 and 1-to-3\u2014a commonly estimated figure for the current war. An Israeli intelligence source interviewed by +972 Magazine claimed that time constraints made it impossible to \u201cincriminate\u201d every target, which raised the IDF\u2019s tolerance for the margin of statistical error from using AI-powered target recommendation systems\u2014as well as its tolerance for the associated \u201ccollateral damage.\u201d Adding to this was the pressure to retaliate against the enemy for their devastating initial attack, with what another source described as a single-minded desire to \u201cfuck up Hamas, no matter what the cost.\u201d Lavender might have been used more judiciously if not for the deadly interaction effect that emerged between a seemingly objective machine and the intense emotional atmosphere of desperation and vengefulness within IDF war rooms. There are larger lessons to learn. The most significant of these is that AI cannot shield the use of weapons from the force of single-minded, vindictive, or negligent commanders, operators, or institutional norms. In fact, it can act as a shield or justification for them. A senior IDF source quoted in the Local Call and +972 investigation said that he had \u201cmuch more trust in a statistical mechanism than a soldier who lost a friend two days ago.\u201d But manifestly, a set of machines is just as easily implicated in mass killing at a scale exceeding previous norms than a vengeful conscript fighting his way through a dense urban neighborhood. It is tempting for bureaucracies, military or otherwise, to outsource difficult judgements made in difficult times to machines, thus allowing risky or controversial decisions to be made by no one in particular even as they are broadly implemented. But legal, ethical, and disciplinary oversight cannot be outsourced to computers, and algorithms mask the biases, limits, and errors of their data inputs behind a seductive veneer of assumed objectivity. The appeal of human-machine teams and algorithmic systems is often claimed to be efficiency\u2014but these systems cannot be scaled up indefinitely without generating counternormative and counterproductive outcomes. Lavender was not intended to be the only arbiter of target legitimacy, and the targets that it recommends could be subject to exhaustive review, should its operators desire it. But under enormous pressure, IDF intelligence analysts reportedly devoted almost no resources to double-checking targets, nor to double-checking bystander locations after feeding the names of targets into Where\u2019s Dad. Such systems are purpose-built, and officials should remember that even under emergency circumstances, they should proceed with caution when expanding the frequency or scope of a computer tool. The hoped-for operational benefits are not guaranteed, and as the catastrophe in Gaza shows, the strategic\u2014and moral\u2014costs could be significant.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Some politicians have called student protesters a threat. Instead, they are providing us all with an education in democracy.",
                    "post_content": "For the last several nights, my sleep has been seriously disturbed by the loud chopping sounds of helicopters that have circled low before dawn in the skies of Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, my New York neighborhood. Each day that has followed, I have made my way a few blocks north to the site of the object of this extraordinary show of policing, the campus of Columbia University, where I have long taught, and the recent birthplace of a momentous student protest movement. As protests on my school\u2019s campus have unfolded, they have spurred increasingly widespread emulation on other campuses across the country. And these, in turn, have inspired a growing chain of reactions by university administrators, politicians, and law enforcement, respectively, that have sought to curtail, prevent, denounce, or crack down on student demonstrations\u2014in more and more cases, violently. What this moment has revealed most clearly to me is not so much a crisis of student culture or of U.S. higher education, as some have claimed, but rather a crisis of politics in the United States that centers on the country\u2019s foreign policy, and specifically its close, long-standing relationship with Israel. Before explaining further, a couple of disclaimers are in order. What follows is no defense of hate speech. Antisemitism is deeply repugnant, as are all forms of racism, no matter what flavor or color they come in. This includes the deep institutional history of antisemitism once practiced by my own university, which historically restricted the admission and hiring of Jews largely in order to shield white Protestants from academic competition. I have no doubt that instances of attacks, harassment, and insults against Jewish students or any supporters of Israel have occurred on U.S. campuses in recent days, and they are truly and inexcusably deplorable. But the limited experience I have of my own campus tells me that such occurrences are not especially commonplace. My impression has been bolstered by seeing the same footage aired on Fox News for an entire week of a menacing heckler screaming in support of Hamas in the face of a Jewish man as he emerged from the subway stop just outside of Columbia\u2019s main gate. It is anything but clear that this abusive person was a student. Furthermore, my campus has been surrounded by television crews working long shifts every day, so if incidents like this were rife, it seems likely that we would be seeing many others instead of replays of the same encounter over and over. What I have seen inside the university\u2019s gates has generally been a picture of exemplary civility. For nine days now, there has been an orderly encampment of students, most of them chatting relaxedly, some of them with tents, occupying an expanse of lawn in front of Butler Library, the biggest of Columbia\u2019s libraries. The demonstrating students have even posted (and overwhelmingly seem to be living by) an admirable code of conduct. It reads in part: Don\u2019t litter; no drug or alcohol use; respect personal boundaries; do not engage with counter-protesters. I will return to the last of these momentarily. On a recent day, as I have many times before, I read the storied names chiseled above Butler Library\u2019s colonnaded neoclassical fa\u00e7ade: Herodotus, Sophocles, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Vergil, and the like. Then I asked myself: What is the threat to Western civilization, to U.S. democracy, or even to higher education that the Columbia protests and others that have followed them are supposed to pose? The answer seems to lie more in a fear of the protesting students\u2019 speech than in their abuse of speech. And the key seems to lie precisely in a line from their code of conduct that I\u2019ve just paraphrased: They forswore engaging not just with any counter-protesters but specifically with \u201cZionist\u201d ones. Here comes another disclaimer. I have no issue with the support that many Jews express for Zionism. Their venerable faith, one of the oldest in the world, has sustained one of humanity\u2019s greatest stories of identity, perseverance, and survival. It is rooted in Old Testament stories of exodus and claims that many Jews take as legitimate to an ancient homeland called Israel. To me, the extermination and persecution of Jews on a monumental scale in Europe during the Holocaust understandably deepen the attachment to Zionism for many Jewish faithful, as does the more recent, and largely unacknowledged, rank discrimination that Jews suffered in Western societies even in the postwar years. Yet the ongoing campus movement that sprang forth from Columbia arose not out of anti-Jewishness, as some would have it. It grew out of profound shock over the hideous and indiscriminate violence that Israel has visited upon Palestinians in the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas that killed an estimated 1,200 Israelis. The protesting students have been scorned and ridiculed as the dangerous and na\u00efve cats\u2019 paws of the United States\u2019 enemies in China or Russia, or, wildest of all, of George Soros, himself Jewish. Worse, they have been mischaracterized as anti-Jewish hatemongers by critics, including by leading U.S. politicians. In the early days of their protests, more than 100 students were carried off by the police in handcuffs after Columbia\u2019s president, Nemat Shafik, spoke of their encampment as a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d and invited police action. On other campuses since then, as this peace movement has spread, students have been beaten and tear-gassed; students at Indiana University and Ohio State University claimed to see snipers stationed on campus, though an Ohio State spokesperson said they were \u201cstate troopers in a watching position, similar to football game day.\u201d Day after day, there have been scenes of supporting faculty members roughed up, knocked to the ground, handcuffed, and carted off by the police. It is time for Americans to ask, swapping out the topic of Israel-Palestine for another, if a student protest movement like this were happening on such a scale in other countries, what would the U.S. response be? What I readily imagine are high-toned condemnations from State Department spokespeople and tut-tutting editorials in the leading U.S. press about authoritarian intolerance or the decay of democracy. There are many other pressing questions. For instance, what is the appropriate citizen\u2019s response to the scale of horror that we are seeing in Gaza? When Washington has not been outright supportive of the Israeli offensive there, supplying enormous quantities of new weapons to Israel with few real constraints on their use, it has simply been impassive. Despite this, some U.S. politicians treat the protesters as a threat. Others warn that demonstrators are interfering with the education of non-demonstrating students, a kind of silent majority, to invoke a phrase familiar to student protests against the Vietnam War. This is exactly backward. By peacefully protesting, the students at Columbia and on a growing number of other campuses are providing U.S. society and indeed the world with an education in democracy and citizenship. This has come home to me in encampment-side conversations with students from China and other countries who have marveled at the ability of Columbia\u2019s students to push back through protest. Amid atrocity, they are saying enough, and almost always doing so peacefully. They are saying that standing up to horror requires more urgency than letter-writing campaigns to members of Congress or patiently waiting to vote in the next election. Gaza is far from the only horror in the world, and we could all use more of these students\u2019 moral urgency and civility. They are pushing where they most readily can, on the institutions for whom, as students, they form the very bedrock of community. If they can\u2019t get the U.S. government to do something to stop the violence in Gaza and increasingly in the West Bank, which goes largely ignored, they can at least get their universities to stop supporting it. This is what the demand for divestment means: denying institutional support through investment in Israeli war efforts until there is peace. Many critics object that this is unrealistic and can never work. But what is the proper citizen response? Sitting on one\u2019s hands in resignation? I wish to close on the question of Zionism. For decades, public opinion in the United States and in much of the world has supported this concept, the notion of Israel\u2019s special right to exist as an ethno-religious homeland for Jewish people. Personally, I recall the excitement I felt for them, seeing Jewish friends of mine in high school eagerly going off to kibbutzim and in other capacities to help build Israel on this basis in a more innocent era decades ago. But the threat to Zionism in today\u2019s world doesn\u2019t come from the students demonstrating on U.S. campuses. I would argue that the greatest threat to Zionism doesn\u2019t even come from Hamas, whose attacks on Israelis are an abomination. No, the greatest threat stems from the blurring of any line between Zionism and the crushing of Palestinian lives and hope for the future. To the extent that the demonstrating students are sending this message, they are Israel\u2019s friends.",

                    "post_content": "Almost from the moment of \u201cIsrael\u2019s 9/11\u201d\u2014even as U.S. President Joe Biden flew to Israel after the Oct. 7 catastrophe to show his complete support\u2014the Biden administration began warning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government not to make the same mistakes the United States did after its own 9/11. In other words, don\u2019t get bogged down in an endless quagmire with no way out. Don\u2019t create more terrorists by using brutal tactics. Don\u2019t do what we did by invading and occupying Iraq. \u201cJustice must be done. But I caution this\u2014while you feel that rage, don\u2019t be consumed by it,\u201d Biden said during that visit last October. \u201cAfter 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. While we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.\u201d Six months in, it\u2019s safe to say that advice didn\u2019t take. Israel\u2014still very much consumed by rage\u2014is clearly getting pulled into an Iraq-like quagmire in Gaza. Like the Baath Party in Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq, much of Hamas\u2019 leadership is gradually being destroyed. In fact, U.S. officials say Israeli tactics have been more effective than they thought, especially in penetrating the tunnel network with a minimum of Israeli casualties. But Israel has not even begun to contemplate a viable way out. And as in Iraq, there are already signs of a rising insurgency, and a new generation of militants, that could bedevil Israel for years. Indeed, despite the very public criticism of Israel\u2019s scorched-earth military campaign in recent weeks, U.S. officials say that what irks them even more than the ongoing humanitarian disaster is Israel\u2019s complete failure to consider what it\u2019s going to do in Gaza even one day after. \u201cIf there\u2019s one extreme frustration with the Israeli side, it is the lack of any credible phase four plan,\u201d a senior Biden administration official said in an interview, referring to the post-conflict phase when some form of governance is restored to the Gaza Strip. (Phase one was the air bombardment after Oct. 7; phase two, the ground invasion; and phase three will be mop-up.) The Israeli government hasn\u2019t moved beyond the idea of organizing local clans to run things and is completely rejecting the idea of a \u201creconstituted\u201d Palestinian Authority (PA) to take over Gaza. Even the more moderate opposition leader, Benny Gantz\u2014Netanyahu\u2019s most likely successor as prime minister\u2014doesn\u2019t want to bring in the PA, the official added, and plans have remained stuck at vague concepts of a transitional council composed of unknown potential members. \u201cThe Arabs are ready to help, but they\u2019re not just going to glom onto some new [Palestinian] creation if it\u2019s not defined,\u201d the official said. For months, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has flown back and forth around the region to orchestrate what could be a promising future regional peace structure for Israel. This includes the once-unimaginable possibility of recognition by Saudi Arabia and virtually every other Arab state. All the Israelis would likely have to do in return, after disposing of Hamas\u2019s leadership and military structure (which the other Arab regimes have little use for), would be to show a willingness to discuss some possibility of Palestinian statehood or autonomy. And even in the event of Palestinian statehood, all parties know that statehood would never mean total sovereignty in terms of military capability. Any new \u201cPalestine\u201d would be a rump state. Yet the Israelis, still traumatized by Oct. 7, aren\u2019t discussing any of this\u2014not even conceptually, according to Biden administration officials and other observers. One problem, as officials in the Biden administration acknowledge, is that after the horrors of the Hamas attack, even moderate Israelis can\u2019t yet stomach the idea of handing the Palestinians a state or even an autonomous entity, and Netanyahu can\u2019t keep his fragile right-wing coalition together unless he continues to robustly oppose the idea. The Americans haven\u2019t helped much with their own signaling. While Biden in recent weeks has hammered Netanyahu in public over the humanitarian disaster, the U.S. president hasn\u2019t pushed a political solution in a very visible way. After Israeli accusations that some United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) staff might be connected to the Oct. 7 attacks, Biden even agreed to defund the UNRWA through March 2025, although that group is the only organized non-Hamas bureaucracy operating in Gaza. With about 13,000 employees in Gaza, most of them Palestinian, UNRWA operates health clinics, infrastructure projects, schools, and aid programs, and more than 1 million Palestinian refugees are still sheltering in its facilities. The partial crippling of UNRWA in turn has worsened the humanitarian crisis as the few truck convoys that do get through tend to get mobbed, with food and assistance distributed unevenly. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said 2 million Palestinians in Gaza, or 87 percent of the population, depend on the UNRWA for sustenance. \u201cThe failure to distribute aid is actually the biggest bottleneck at the moment,\u201d said Michael Koplow of the Israel Policy Forum in Washington. Koplow points to the chaos and violence by armed gangs\u2014and in some cases shootouts between returning Hamas militants and PA or Fatah gunmen\u2014that have arisen in the north and in the area of Khan Younis as the Israelis withdraw, thus exacerbating a crisis begun by the Israeli blockade. \u201cThere are no more functioning institutions, and no plan has been set forth for replacing any of them,\u201d he said in a phone interview. Privately, most Israeli security officials recognize that their government is being unrealistic both about the humanitarian crisis and their ability to contain it, as well as postwar governance. \u201cIsraeli security officials are clear eyed on the fact that neither local clans, nor municipal officials can be expected to meet on their own the daunting tasks of governing and rehabilitating the Strip,\u201d Nimrod Novik, a former senior advisor to the late Prime Minister Shimon Peres, said in an email. \u201cThese tasks require massive outside support. However, outsiders\u2014first and foremost key regional players [such as Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states]\u2014refuse to engage (beyond short-term humanitarian assistance) unless it is all done in coordination with the PA.\u201d Congressional supporters of Israel echo these concerns, saying that the Israeli failures carry too many memories of the way the U.S. invaded Iraq without any kind of credible plan for governance after \u201cde-Baathification\u201d\u2014the term used for the U.S. process of removing key elements of Hussein\u2019s regime from Iraqi governance. \u201cI\u2019m deeply worried about what happens in Gaza after the war ends,\u201d U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy said in an interview. \u201cMy chief worry is that this campaign is going to end up with anti-Israel sentiment being stronger, not weaker. \u2026 We have to see a viable plan for who controls and runs Gaza.\u201d On Capitol Hill, congressional oversight of aid to Israel\u2014once as routine as a traffic cop lazily waving through a never-ending motorcade\u2014has suddenly become a serious business. But almost all efforts are now focused on making aid and support to Israel conditional on the opening up of humanitarian corridors rather than plans for after the war. A few key examples: An $18 billion sale of F-15s to Israel, along with other major military aid packages, will not just sashay through the congressional notification process as usually happens, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who has led a campaign in the Senate to apply new tough standards to military aid. \u201cWe will use all the tools in our toolbox to discourage the Biden administration from going down that path,\u201d Van Hollen said in an interview. Van Hollen also said the administration has promised the senators a full briefing before a May 8 deadline for accountability under the president\u2019s national security memo from February. That memo, prompted by a threatened Van Hollen amendment to a spending bill, requires a pledge by Israel that any future U.S. aid will be used in accordance with international law and humanitarian standards, to be followed by a 45-day assessment period by the State Department. \u201cThe whole purpose is to keep the spotlight on this,\u201d Van Hollen said, adding: \u201cI would hope the Biden administration would want to avoid a big fight in the Senate about sending more offensive weapons to the Netanyahu government.\u201d But here, too, the issue of post-conflict Gaza remains an afterthought, and in any case, there is not nearly enough congressional support for a full-on stoppage of military aid. Nor is Biden likely to support such a move, despite political pressure from progressive elements in his party seven months before the U.S. presidential election. True, perhaps never before has the defense of Israel, a constant in U.S. politics, been so toxic. But neither has any U.S. president been as passionately committed to Israel as Biden. Murphy warned that, as a result, U.S. leverage on Israel will remain limited. \u201cI think we have to be sober-minded about the ability of U.S. policy to influence Netanyahu\u2019s decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cThis campaign is not dependent on U.S. aid. Israel is not Ukraine. They have the resources to continue this campaign with or without the United States.\u201d In the past, Israel has rarely moved on a political solution to the Palestinian issue without intense pressure from Washington. Today\u2019s U.S.-Israel tensions are probably the worst since the George H.W. Bush administration more than three decades ago. At that time, then-Secretary of State James Baker threatened to withhold loan guarantees from Israel unless it stopped building settlements on the West Bank as a prelude to entering into serious peace negotiations with the Palestinians. That American pressure ultimately laid the groundwork for the Oslo peace process, which led to repeated failures by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to come to terms for statehood. That in turn gave rise to another intifada and ultimately the takeover of Gaza by Hamas. All in all, the nearly two-decade-long Oslo ordeal left many Israelis dubious of U.S.-led peace efforts. And that was before Oct. 7. It is likely to be doubly true today. All signs point to a long and bloody quagmire ahead. Israel is indeed confronting its own 9/11\u2014 in more ways than one.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The U.S.-led resolution signals a subtle shift in the Biden administration\u2019s stance on the Israel-Hamas war.",
                    "post_content": "Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution at the United Nations Security Council on Friday that urged a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza. The text, which was supported by 10 other members of the 15-member Security Council, called on all parties in the conflict to abide by international humanitarian law and rejected any efforts to reduce the territory of Gaza through the creation of a security buffer zone, an idea that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put forward in his plan for Gaza\u2019s postwar future. The resolution is the latest sign of a subtle shift in the Biden administration\u2019s stance on the war as it seeks to curb the spiraling humanitarian catastrophe in the besieged Palestinian territory. However, experts say it does not represent a meaningful departure from Washington\u2019s long-standing support for Israel at the United Nations.\u00a0 \u201cThe U.S. was not attempting to make a fundamental shift in its policy at the U.N. over the war,\u201d said Richard Gowan, the International Crisis Group\u2019s U.N. director.\u00a0 Washington has historically used its position as a permanent member of the Security Council to defend Israel, including by exercising the U.S. veto.\u00a0Friday was the fourth time the council held a vote on a cease-fire resolution since the start of the war. The previous three efforts were vetoed by the United States for failing to include language referring to Israel\u2019s right to self-defense and for calling for an unconditional cease-fire that was not linked to the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.\u00a0 U.S. sponsorship of this latest resolution was likely intended to send a message to the Netanyahu government. \u201cThe mere fact that the U.S. was willing to do anything in the Security Council at all was a small signal to the Israelis to be cautious,\u201d Gowan said.\u00a0 The Biden administration has stood by Israel in the wake of the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, which saw 1,200 people killed and 240 people taken hostage, and has continued to provide the country with military aid in the face of mounting domestic and international criticism.\u00a0 At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden has become increasingly frustrated by what he has described as the \u201cindiscriminate\u201d nature of Israel\u2019s bombing campaign in Gaza and the throttling of humanitarian aid into the territory. Even if the resolution had passed, it would likely have had little \u201coperational impact,\u201d said Louis Charbonneau, Human Rights Watch\u2019s U.N. director, who noted that the text refrained from using some of the more forceful language seen in other similar Security Council resolutions. \u201cIf you wanted to have strong obligatory language, it would say \u2018demands\u2019 an \u2018immediate and sustained cease-fire.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t say that,\u201d Charbonneau said.\u00a0 Language used in Security Council resolutions is carefully calibrated, as even slight shifts in tone and word choice can carry significant diplomatic meaning. The 2,000-word U.S. resolution tabled on Friday, which refers to Israel by name only once, said the Security Council \u201cdetermines the imperative of an immediate and sustained cease-fire.\u201d Russia and China cited that watered-down wording as a reason for their veto. Ahead of the vote, Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said Moscow supported a cease-fire, but he described the U.S. resolution as an \u201cempty rhetorical exercise.\u201d China\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, made similar comments. \u201cIf the U.S. was serious about a cease-fire, it wouldn\u2019t have vetoed time and again multiple council resolutions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have taken such a detour and played a game of words while being ambiguous and evasive on critical issues.\u201d Russia has faced increased scrutiny at the U.N. over the past two years for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. \u201cThe Russians, in particular, from the get-go used the war [in Gaza] as an opportunity to distract from their own behavior in Ukraine and put the U.S. on the back foot,\u201d Gowan said. Permanent council members have long wielded their vetoes to protect their interests and those of their allies, but they were often able to work effectively on other fronts. Now, tensions between Russia and the West are increasingly seeping into all areas of the council\u2019s work, diplomats say. More than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, including some 13,000 children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry, which is run by Hamas but whose casualty figures are regarded as broadly accurate.\u00a0Israel has severely limited humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has left much of the population on the brink of a catastrophic famine, the World Bank warned this week.\u00a0 Friday\u2019s vote at the Security Council came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the Middle East on his sixth trip to the region since the war began. After a meeting in Cairo to discuss ongoing efforts to broker a cease-fire, Blinken said it would be a \u201cmistake\u201d for Israel to launch a planned ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where 1.4 million Palestinians have sought refuge from the conflict.\u00a0 A defiant Netanyahu said the operation would go ahead, with or without U.S. support. \u201cI hope we will do it with the support of the U.S., but if we have to, we will do it alone,\u201d he said.",

                    "post_content": "The White House has begun to shift its rhetoric on Israel and the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden has called Israel\u2019s response \u201cover the top.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris recently called for an \u201cimmediate cease-fire.\u201d And Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer spoke on the Senate floor this week and called on Israel to hold new elections because its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had \u201clost his way.\u201d But as always, there\u2019s a gap between rhetoric and action. Meanwhile, perceptions of the United States in the Middle East are declining. According to Mina Al-Oraibi, the editor-in-chief of the United Arab Emirates\u2019 flagship English daily the National, this is the lowest point for U.S. policy in the Middle East this century. I spoke with Al-Oraibi on FP Live, the magazine\u2019s platform for live journalism. Subscribers can watch the full discussion on the video box atop this page. What follows is an edited and condensed transcript. Ravi Agrawal: In the United States, we know that the Arab American community is not pleased with the Biden administration\u2019s Middle East policy since Oct. 7. But what about perceptions in the Middle East itself? How do people there think about the White House\u2019s role specifically on the Israel-Palestine issue? Mina Al-Oraibi: There is outrage when it comes to America\u2019s policy over the past five months or so. There\u2019s outrage because the United States has incredible leverage\u2014more than any other country\u2014when it comes to Israel. In the immediate aftermath of Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel, there was no surprise that there was a lot of American support for Israel. There was a real sense that they had to be close to Israel. But there was also disappointment from every Arab capital that in none of the public statements, and it seems none of the private meetings, were American officials telling Israeli officials to take into consideration the civilians on the ground in Gaza. Then, of course, this developed into the United States\u2019 position when it came to using its veto power at the United Nations, repeatedly, to stop the idea of a cease-fire. If you look at how America\u2019s foreign policy is viewed at this moment in time, it really is through the prism of what\u2019s going on in Palestine and Israel. There are wider concerns in the region, ever since the withdrawal from Afghanistan, concerns about disengagement from Iraq, flip-flopping on Yemen and how they perceive the Houthis, and so forth. But at this moment, it really is crystallized in Washington\u2019s mismanagement when it comes to the terrible war that we see continuing in Palestine-Israel. RA: You mentioned Iraq and Afghanistan. If you were to take a wider span, since after 9/11, there have been many low points for the United States in the Middle East. How do you rank this particular moment? MO: It\u2019s [the] lowest point, I would say. During the lead up to the Iraq war, but also after the war and how it was handled, there was a lot of criticism of the United States. But I think there was a sense in many of the policy circles that the United States was at least trying to figure out the right thing to do but was making mistakes. This time it seems very concerted. It seems that this is being thought through and the United States believes that this is the best policy, which is to give full support for Israel. At one point, you had the president question even the numbers of dead civilians in Gaza. And so I would say it\u2019s different this time because it doesn\u2019t even seem that the United States is trying to do what\u2019s right. RA: Wow. If this is Washington\u2019s lowest point in the Middle East, I\u2019m curious if countries there see that as a good or bad thing? MO: The Middle East is very divided. You have the countries that are stable and that believe in the nation state\u2014the Gulf countries, Egypt, and Jordan\u2014they see this as a bad thing. The United States, for all its faults, remains the strongest ally and is seen as the leader of the world order as we know it. That seems to be crumbling. For those countries that are very critical of the United States, from Iran through to Syria and others, they\u2019re delighted. It is feeding into the narrative of the so-called resistance front that would like very much to show the United States in a bad light. The [United Arab Emirates], where I\u2019m based, and other countries that want to see stability and international order, are concerned by the perception of the United States as a bad actor. This war, as tragic as it is, is no longer just confined to Israel and Palestine. It\u2019s seen as Joe Biden\u2019s war. RA: I mentioned at the start that Biden\u2019s rhetoric has shifted in the last few weeks. One persistent critique of him is that while he\u2019s uncomfortable with how Israel is waging this war and the loss of life of innocent civilians, he hasn\u2019t actually been able to exert leverage on its leaders to do much differently. MO: Rhetoric is just rhetoric. There\u2019s not been any conflict in the last 25 years where you haven\u2019t at least had a call for a cease-fire. The fact that the United States was actively working against that has been shocking. I think in the last few weeks the rhetoric has changed, partly because of pressure domestically and partly because Israel has crossed so many boundaries, including the absence of a cease-fire by Ramadan. But, as you see, Biden hasn\u2019t been able to exert leverage. America continues to have the greatest leverage that any country has over Israel. From diplomats to ordinary people, everybody notes that the United States hasn\u2019t been willing to use that leverage. RA: And what\u2019s striking about what you\u2019re describing is there\u2019s this public sense not only of what American policy is, but the divisions within the administration, which all seem now, at this point, clearly telegraphed. I think the phrase you used was, this is \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s war.\u201d How do you think that ends up hurting him? MO: For the Middle East, there is still a respect for the American system that allows for diplomats to send cables of dissent and to push against this from within. But the idea is that ultimately, not only is Biden pursuing this policy, but you\u2019ve also got [U.S.] Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the same place. When he went to Israel in the immediate aftermath of the attack, he stood at the podium and said, \u201cI am here as a Jew.\u201d That surprised people because there are people from all different religions and backgrounds that work in and serve the United States government. RA: When I\u2019ve pushed U.S. officials on using more of their leverage to alter Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, what I often hear back is as follows: that there is a major rise of anti-Semitism\u2014which is real, in the United States and around the world; the fact that Israel has few real friends in the region; that [it] is up against a group that seeks its annihilation. The point that Biden surrogates often make is that Oct. 7[, 2023] so shook to the core Israel\u2019s sense of security, its sense of being, and its sense of its right to exist, that it was pushed to take all these drastic steps we now see. That\u2019s what they say. But how is that line of thinking received in the Arab world? MO: I don\u2019t think anyone underestimates the level of trauma, shock, and pain that Israel feels after the Oct. 7 attack. We don\u2019t take that out of context. However, every line has been crossed. The attacks on hospitals, on [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNWRA)] facilities, on UNWRA itself, as well as the threat of famine and the starvation that Palestinians are going through now, make it very hard to put that context of Oct. 7 out there. The reality is it doesn\u2019t have to be this harsh. One of the things that Israel was known for was its strong intelligence and military. Its intelligence clearly failed to pick up the signs of how brutal the Oct. 7 attack would be. But even now, going into the sixth month of the war\u2014and we\u2019ve seen the level of devastation\u2014how much of Israel\u2019s so-called objective of eliminating Hamas has been met? For all those reasons, there is a sense that as traumatic as this is for Israel, Israel should be thinking much more strategically. And if Israel can\u2019t think strategically because of the shock and the frustration, then surely the country that claims to be its closest ally should then step in and say, \u201cAs your friend and ally, we need to help you navigate through this period to not destroy what little alliances you do have in the region\u201d and also hold them accountable. RA: What about the fact that Hamas refuses to back down from calling for the end of the state of Israel? Do Arab leaders have a solution for how to deal with a group like that? MO: Arab countries see Hamas as more problematic than Israel. The vast majority of Arabs don\u2019t want to be living under the rule of Hamas. The problem is that is a very difficult conversation to have at a moment when the Palestinians are under such attack. No one can accept not only the rhetoric but also the actions of Hamas. But at the end of the day, the occupation continues. Hamas was enabled at a time when the Palestinian Authority was systematically eroded by actions that Israel took. It doesn\u2019t in any way justify what Hamas is saying or doing. But at the end of the day, you can\u2019t hold Hamas to the same level as you would expect from Israel, [which] is considered a democratic nation state and has the full support of the United States. RA: Last week, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence here in the United States, said that the Gaza conflict will have a generational impact on terrorism. What do you make of that? MO: I think it\u2019s an important statement to make. One of my concerns is that people have moved on way too quickly from the complete collapse of the government of Afghanistan and the takeover of the Taliban. The message there is the people with the guns kept fighting and, in the end, got back power from the greatest army in the world. Then you look to the Houthis in Yemen and their war against their own people. The Houthis are claiming credibility that they\u2019re able to affect international commerce. Then we go to Hamas and the narrative is that Hamas was able to deal the largest blow to Israel since its existence and establishment. Hamas is able to say that \u201cwe were able to do what no Arab army was willing to do.\u201d So if you\u2019re a young, frustrated person who feels they have no agency, how do you get agency at the moment? It seems like you pick up a gun or you join one of these militant groups, and we\u2019re seeing that with different militia groups across the region.

                    "post_content": "Something strange is going on with Israel, writes Elie Barnavi, a former Israeli ambassador to France and a prominent historian and writer, in his autobiography\u202fConfessions d\u2019un bon \u00e0 rien: In less than a century his country \u201chas gone through the entire sequence of European wars, but in reverse order.\u201d\u00a0 Barnavi\u2019s book (which has not been translated into English) was published in 2022. He could not have known at the time that a furious war between Israel and Hamas would erupt in late 2023. Even so, his analysis of Israel getting involved in Europeans wars \u201cbut in reverse order\u201d is perfectly applicable to the war now raging in Gaza. To be sure, his vision is pitch dark: Israel\u2019s wars are getting worse, in Barnavi\u2019s view. Therefore, the potential for further escalation of the Gaza war in the wider region is considerable.\u00a0 What exactly does it mean to have European wars in reverse order? In Europe, religious wars raged on for most of the 16th and 17th centuries, fought between Catholics and protestants and their regional, princely or city-state backers. The situation only changed after the Peace of Westphalia, in 1648, a double peace treaty that put an end to both the Thirty Years\u2019 War in the Holy Roman Empire and the Eighty Years\u2019 War between Spain and the Dutch Republic. From then on, states became the predominant actors in international politics. They certainly fought terrible wars, but also managed to contain and prevent them through peace conferences\u2014the Concert of Vienna (1814-15) for example\u2014where European powers guaranteed non-interference in each other\u2019s spheres of influence. Finally, interstate wars in Europe stopped altogether after the Second World War, at least among member states of what has become the European Union.\u00a0 Israel, Barnavi argues, took the opposite trajectory. Israel\u2019s wars began as battles between states: the Jewish state against neighboring Arab states, involving one national army fighting another. This interstate warfare ended with the Yom Kippur War in 1973. After that, Israel no longer fought large-scale wars against other states and instead mainly fought Palestinian guerrillas. Even in that new phase, however, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remained a conflict between two nations, two national movements, over the same piece of land. Because of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza strip, this struggle\u2014which is raging still today\u2014took on a colonial dimension.\u00a0\u00a0 Beyond that, crucially, the war has changed in character. On both sides, politics and society are now deeply divided. Both in Israel and Palestine, the main internal division is between those who are secular and those who are religiously motivated. On both sides, the religious camp seems to be getting the upper hand.\u00a0 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Politico\u202fwrote recently, is \u201closing control\u201d of his government because his far-right, religious coalition partners are uncompromising and pushing their way. For instance, the Israeli Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir\u2014who both live in Israeli settlements in the West Bank\u2014have publicly called for \u201cmigration\u201d of Palestinians from Gaza and building new Israeli settlements there, and have referred to Palestinians as \u201chuman animals\u201d and \u201cNazis.\u201d Despite U.S. pressure, they have also refused to transfer tax revenues that Israel routinely collects for the Palestinian Authority to the government in Ramallah, Palestine\u2019s de facto administrative capital. Netanyahu obviously no longer controls his own ministers. His religious coalition partners know he will not fire them. If he does, the government would fall and the prime minister, who faces charges on three cases of fraud, bribery and breach of trust, would lose the immunity that currently keeps him out of reach of the judiciary.\u00a0 On the Palestinian side, things are no better. For many Palestinians, 88-year old Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has lost all credibility. Under his 19-year tenure, the Palestinian cause and the fight against the Israeli occupation have largely disappeared from the international agenda. Hamas puts them back on that agenda.\u202fA December 2023 poll showed that Hamas\u2019s popularity was actually growing\u2014even among secular Palestinians who normally do not support Hamas and condemn the Oct. 7, 2023, massacres. This result should be seen as a sign of utter political despair; they have lost hope that less extremist leaders can achieve a just peace with Israel.\u00a0 In this way, what used to be a national conflict is increasingly turning into a religious conflict. Barnavi, who has studied Europe\u2019s religious wars extensively as a scholar, writes: \u201cThe growing power of fundamentalists on both sides drags us back to the pre-modern, pre-Westphalian era\u2014to the religious wars in Europe of the second half of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th\u202fcentury.\u201d\u00a0 This is bad news. Europe\u2019s wars of religion were terrible. Everybody was fighting everybody, and there was no restraint in warfare. The French 16th-century philosopher Michel de Montaigne lived through them and wrote about them in his Essays. These wars led him to develop his theory of political governance and change through \u201cpetits pas\u201d (little steps) instead of revolutionary, sweeping movements, so as to contain extremism and bloodshed. If religious lunatics have their way, he noted, compromises are no longer possible.\u00a0\u00a0 Barnavi, without mentioning Montaigne, seems to come to the same conclusion. Two countries can negotiate a deal, he argues in his memoirs, with both settling for less than they originally demanded, using rational considerations. But two camps that deeply believe God has given them the land are incapable of doing this, because it requires them to renege on the fundament on which their faith and identity are based.\u00a0 The question whether Israel and the Palestinians can get their stranded peace process back on track thus depends less and less on negotiations between both sides\u2014which was the case 30 years ago, resulting in the Oslo peace accords\u2014and more and more on the struggle\u202fwithin\u202fthe two camps between secular and religious parties. The more intense these internal power struggles become, the less likely the peace process can be put into motion again. This means, of course, that it also becomes more likely that the conflict will be settled militarily. \u00a0 European religious wars were eventually stopped because of the emergence of the modern, relatively secular state capable of compromise; its claims of the\u202fraison d\u2019\u00e9tat\u202feventually prevailed. The religious war in the Middle East, by contrast, is currently intensifying because the state (or the national movement, on the Palestinian side, which also used to be secular in character) is becoming weaker.\u00a0 If both sides are unable to broker a compromise, someone else needs to make sure things don\u2019t spiral out of control, with Israel\u2019s neighbors and other regional powers, including Iran (which is a theocracy itself), getting more directly involved. One can only hope that intensive diplomatic efforts, mainly by the United States and some Gulf states, behind the screens will eventually bear fruit. But thanks to books such as Barnavi\u2019s, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: Compromise is now harder than ever.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Indifference to Palestinian suffering in Gaza is alienating moderates across the Islamic world and tarnishing the appeal of liberal democratic values.",
                    "post_content": "Since the beginning of Israel\u2019s catastrophic war in Gaza, triggered by the gruesome Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, policymakers in Washington have worried about containing the conflict. The military escalations\u2014stretching from Lebanon through Syria, Iraq, and down to Jordan and Yemen\u2014suggest that they may not have been very successful at that. But there is another problem they may not be even fully aware of: Across the Middle East and even the broader Muslim world, there is an unprecedented level of outrage against the United States and its Western allies, which may have long-lasting consequences. It could be much worse than the impact of the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003\u2014the example that some have in mind these days\u2014because the carnage that Israel has inflicted in Gaza seems much worse than anything that happened during U.S. military interventions in the Middle East. Any close observer of the region can see this. Among them is Fawaz Gerges, a renowned expert on Middle East politics, who warned in December: \u201cI have never seen the region as implosive, as boiling. There is so much rage and anger, not only against Israel but against the United States.\u201d As Pakistani journalist Umer Farooq observed, \u201cThe War In Gaza Is Changing The Muslim World\u201d\u2014and not in a good way. There is a widespread anger, he argues, that \u201cwill boost fundamentalist tendencies in Muslim societies,\u201d and perhaps incubate new terrorist groups. Why this outrage? Because millions of people are watching the horrific scenes from Gaza every single day\u2014often on live television. Whole neighborhoods are bombed, with the dead bodies of babies and children protruding from the rubble. Innocent civilians are shot to death, even in the relatively calmer West Bank. Local health authorities report that more than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, most of them women and children; 90 percent of Gazans have been displaced from their homes, and they are at the brink of starvation and disease. Many Muslims then look at what Western leaders, such as U.S. President Joe Biden, are saying about all this. All that they hear is about Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. All they see are more U.S. dollars and weapons being granted to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government to continue the campaign. Of course, Israel has a right to defend itself, as any fair-minded observer would accept. Any country has that right against terrorists that target its innocent civilians. But why would a so-called war on terror that kills dozens of times more innocent civilians than terrorism itself be legitimate? How can a horrific death rate, worse any other conflict in recent history, along with the widespread deprivation of food, water, and medicine, be excused as collateral damage? The brutal battle to dislodge the Islamic State from Mosul, Iraq\u2014another densely populated city\u2014killed far fewer civilians. To many people, especially in the Muslim world, the answer seems to be that Israeli lives matter more, much more, than Palestinian lives. And that comes across as a historic denial of the liberal values that Western governments have championed since the end of World War II: universal human rights and the inherent dignity of all human life. Some would say that these lofty ideals were never fully pursued, as national interests, alliances, and hypocrisy often led to double standards. But past examples\u2014such as U.S. support for friendly Arab dictators, or CIA-backed coups in Iran or elsewhere\u2014were hardly ever this blatant or so in-your-face. The loss of faith in Western norms is not just affecting those already inclined to be anti-American or critical of the Western-led order. Among them are liberal-leaning Muslims who have long admired the political values of the West and often pointed to them, but now feel that the standard-bearer has betrayed its own principles. One of them is Turkish journalist Nihal Bengisu Karaca, who wrote a sad piece on \u201cthe suicide of the West.\u201d \u201cFrom now on, on this side of the world,\u201d she asked, \u201cWho can refer to \u2018global values,\u2019 \u2018Western liberal democracies\u2019\u2026 Who would listen to them?\u201d Another liberal Muslim lamenting \u201cthe West\u2019s credibility crisis\u201d is Pakistani diplomat Hina Rabbani Khar, who was hailed globally in 2011 as the nation\u2019s first female foreign affairs minister. \u201cI believe that the West has much to celebrate in its human rights and development records,\u201d she wrote in Al Jazeera in January, only to add: \u201cBut I also know that the West has shown glaring disregard for these principles outside of its own geography.\u201d She then issued a warning: \u201cWashington\u2019s stance today would not only undermine efforts to promote it as the only reliable world power, but would also sabotage its ability to play the role of a peace builder in the future.\u201d Others are even more repelled by the West, renouncing it categorically. A dramatic example was a message posted by a Mauritanian professor of philosophy, Al-Mustafa ould Klaib, which reportedly went viral on Arab social media. \u201cI have become ashamed before my students whom I have taught, over decades, the Enlightenment and modern Western philosophies,\u201d the professor wrote. He apologized for \u201cglorifying\u201d Western notions like \u201chumanism,\u201d \u201cprogress,\u201d and \u201cliberty,\u201d only to add: \u201cThe West is the biggest lie history has known.\u201d Among American Muslims, too, most of whom appreciate the liberties and opportunities they have enjoyed in the United States, the carnage in Gaza, with Washington\u2019s backing, has created an unprecedented disappointment. The popular feeling was expressed by the prominent Imam Omar Suleiman, who, outraged by the images of children killed in Gaza, declared, \u201cany semblance of international law or standard for humanity is dead.\u201d To those who usually pontificate about them, he added: \u201cDon\u2019t ever lecture us on morality again. Your hearts are dead.\u201d As a Muslim who still believes in liberal ideals and even the qualities of the West, I disagree with those who are drawn to anti-Westernism. I would remind them that many of my co-religionists around the world are threatened more by the so-called East. They include Ukrainian and Balkan Muslims who are threatened by Russia and its allies and Uyghur Muslims who are ruthlessly persecuted by China. At least in the West, governments can still be criticized, human rights groups can speak out, peace activists get heard, and forever wars may be ended through popular pressure\u2014because there is freedom of speech. Yet, Gaza\u2019s repercussions are threatening that core liberal value as well. In Europe, especially Germany, there is an unprecedented wave of censorship and crackdowns on criticism of Israel and any form of pro-Palestinian expression\u2014even mere Palestinian flags and keffiyehs can be banned. In the United States, a politician as prominent as Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives can tie \u201ccease-fire now\u201d demonstrations to a foreign conspiracy by Russia\u2014the same kind of allegation used in Russia itself, or Iran, to demonize anti-regime demonstrations. All of this is rapidly discrediting the West\u2014and its liberal narratives\u2014in the eyes of the rest. For if human rights are not valid for all humans, and if freedom of speech is not valid for all voices, those principles don\u2019t mean much. The world instead seems to run on the cynical principle defined by Carl Schmitt, the \u201ccrown jurist\u201d of Germany\u2019s Third Reich: Sovereign powers, at their will, can define the exceptions to their rules. Such a blatantly post-liberal world would be a scary place for all of us. As Western democracies cast aside their principles, illiberal forces such as Russia, China, and Iran would gain more power and prestige. New militant groups could emerge in the Muslim world, even more ferocious than the ones we have seen, provoking even worse conflicts if not actual clashes of civilizations. It will also undermine U.S. and European efforts to forge future alliances in times of war or drum up support for sanctions against their adversaries. As Foreign Policy deputy editor Sasha Polakow-Suransky warned in these pages, that could mark a significant geostrategic shift: \u201cMost foreign leaders\u2014and populations\u2014outside of Europe and North America now simply don\u2019t take U.S. or European appeals to support Ukraine on humanitarian grounds seriously,\u201d he wrote, and future moral appeals\u2014no matter how just the cause\u2014are likely to fall on deaf ears. What\u2019s most frustrating is that the Western policy that has placed the world on this dangerous track, this uncritical support for a catastrophic war led by the most far-right government in Israel\u2019s history, is not even good for Israel. The past four months have shown that large numbers of hostages can be rescued through diplomatic negotiations, not relentless onslaught. The ambitious goal of completely destroying Hamas\u00a0is not realistic, as experts have been saying from the beginning. Instead, veteran Haaretz journalist Gideon Levy warns that, at the end, \u201cIsrael\u2019s dignity will be damaged,\u201d and \u201cHamas will be crowned winner.\u201d Such Israeli voices of moderation may not be heard enough, because the nation is understandably experiencing a moment of shock and vengeance after the horror of Oct. 7\u2014like the United States after the 9/11 attacks. But that is precisely why friends of Israel should not give a blank check to some of its worst actors, including government officials making open calls for ethnic cleansing. Sober Israeli voices with deep knowledge of the country\u2019s security challenges also see a dead end in the long term. Among them is Ami Ayalon, the former head of Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security agency, who wisely warns: \u201cWe Israelis will have security only when they, Palestinians, will have hope.\u201d Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak has said that for \u201cour own security, our own future,\u201d Israel\u2019s endgame should be \u201ca Palestinian state.\u201d In short, those who are destroying Palestinian hopes are not only ruining Gaza\u2019s present, but also risking Israel\u2019s future. They are even risking the future of freedom and peace in our already turbulent world. Before it is too late, the Biden administration must change course\u2014by pushing for an immediate cease-fire, urgent relief, and a clear path to peace. Otherwise, whatever political wisdom or moral authority the West ever had may vanish in the eyes of the rest. China, Russia, Iran, and other autocracies may gain prestige and leverage that they don\u2019t deserve. The Muslim world may become only more open to the forces of illiberalism, fundamentalism, and militancy. And the \u201cliberal world order,\u201d which was perhaps an unfulfilled but still worthy aspiration, may be replaced with a more cynical, violent, and oppressive disorder.",

                    "post_content": "With an Israeli offensive in Rafah looming, the United States continues to face several dilemmas in addressing the evolving humanitarian disaster in Gaza. A growing chorus of American citizens and policymakers alike are asking how the U.S. can support Israeli security while also protecting Palestinian civilians. Coercing allies is tricky diplomatic business\u2014especially when it comes to pushing policies that restrict a partner\u2019s approach to national defense. Plus, the long-standing U.S. commitment to Israel diminishes U.S. bargaining power further. Far from feeling that they owe the Americans any favors, Israeli decision-makers in crisis are likely wagering that U.S. interests in maintaining an established strategic partnership against shared and emboldened enemies, including the Houthis and Iranians, will prevent Washington from pressing too hard on Israeli policymakers. The most-often discussed pathway for the U.S. to pressure partners is making aid conditional on reforms. Last week, following mounting pressures from prominent Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chris Van Hollen, President Joe Biden signed a \u201chistoric\u201d directive that would require all U.S. strategic partners to submit written confirmation certifying that U.S.-provided military assistance was being used in compliance with international law. However, it is unclear how this will impact Israeli policy or how the Biden administration will respond to violations. Part of the lack of clarity over what, if anything, this action does for Palestinians in Gaza or for U.S.-Israeli relations is a failure to appreciate the complications involved in making aid conditional on reform. American diplomats have been here before. The U.S. is aiming to broadly support its partner while also protecting its interests, a challenge it has previously encountered with local allies in its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Of course, those alliances of counterinsurgency occupation were very different from the U.S.-Israel partnership, as Kabul and Baghdad had far more limited institutional and military capacity compared to Israel. Nevertheless, despite significant differences in the dynamics of those partnerships, Washington has had to figure out how to support a key ally while maintaining U.S. norms and interests, such as promoting democracy and protecting human rights. History shows that in pressuring Israel to moderate its policies in Gaza, conditional aid may not work as well as an often-overlooked diplomatic tool: the threat of unilateral U.S. action. In theory, \u201ctough love\u201d in the form of conditional aid allows the U.S. to trade material for influence. However, in reality, the politics of such approaches are more complicated and riskier for the U.S. than they appear. First, limiting aid risks weakening the partner, which almost always runs against U.S. interests. If the partner fails, the United States is also in a less secure position vis-\u00e0-vis the shared threats that motivate the partnership in the first place. This in turn limits the credibility of such threats, as partners understand that the U.S. will also suffer consequences if Washington follows through. In 2009, then-President Barack Obama publicly called on Afghan President Hamid Karzai to crack down on corruption and the drug trade in Afghanistan. When asked why the U.S. did not withhold troops and aid to leverage said reforms, a former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan candidly called the argument \u201cstupid.\u201d This is because weakening Karzai risked emboldening the Taliban, extending the U.S. intervention, and setting back key nation-building benchmarks the U.S. had set for itself and its partners in Afghanistan. Second, withdrawing aid potentially damages the future of the partnership. If partners decide that Washington has undermined their security, they may be motivated to seek alternative allies, including Russia in the case of Israel. The current Israeli mindset of insecurity and isolation means that unless it is done with exceptional skill, U.S. threats to significantly limit military aid during an ongoing Israel Defense Forces operation will likely be met with resentment and resistance by Israeli officials. Third, unlike pundits, policymakers have the heavy responsibility of dealing with critical allies calling Washington\u2019s bluff and refusing to comply with U.S. demands. Defiant allies create a lose-lose scenario for the U.S. Either American officials follow through on declared penalties and risk undermining strategic partners and possibly emboldening shared adversaries, or they fail to impose the costs and lose credibility and future leverage. Thus, despite reports that the Biden administration is willing to delay weapons delivery to Israel, it is unsurprising that the White House is yet to announce a clear plan. These risks make aid conditionality a blunt tactic typically held in reserve by U.S. diplomats, as opposed to a sustainable diplomatic approach. The more the U.S. relies on a partner, the less attractive aid conditionality becomes. Admittedly, unconditional aid is also risky since it leaves the U.S. at least partially liable for the partner\u2019s policies, even ghastly ones. For example, in Iraq, former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s determination to resist U.S. urges to incorporate Sunni political forces into his government was a contributor to the insurgency that took over parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014. Luckily, there is an alternative way to pressure partners. Instead, the U.S. can shift partner behavior by threatening to implement policies that affect local politics unilaterally, with or without partner participation. The coercive message to partners is \u201ceither you implement X policy, or we will,\u201d unlike the logic of aid conditionality that states \u201cimplement X policy, or the U.S. will cut your support.\u201d The former message is focused on the specific policy in question, as opposed to threats of cutting key resources, which can harm the ally and alliance more broadly. The threat of select unilateral action is not meant to propose wide-scale U.S. intervention but can instead be tailored to impact local policies that are specifically harmful to U.S. interests. Though allies will likely perceive it as a coercive threat to their autonomy and not welcome this message, the goal is to raise the stakes and pressure allies into reaching a compromise. Threatening unilateral U.S. action in response to partner inaction often motivated local allies in Iraq, Vietnam, and Afghanistan to comply with U.S. demands, at least in part, because unilateral action would have undermined local elites and put them in an increasingly isolated position. In Iraq, for instance, the U.S. was able to successfully use this approach to coerce Maliki into further engaging with Sunni groups in 2010 because the U.S. was credibly threatening to continue its engagement with amenable Sunni leaders\u2014with or without the support of Shiite leaders in Baghdad. (However, Washington lost this leverage when it no longer threatened to support Sunni militias unilaterally as part of the 2011 U.S. withdrawal from Iraq.) The U.S. was also able to pry concessions out of local partners in Saigon during the U.S. withdrawal because of credible threats that the U.S. would move forward with compromises to North Vietnam with or without South Vietnamese participation. In 2010, the U.S. was able to promote moderate anti-corruption reforms in Afghanistan by bringing in U.N. officials to report on progress. Rather than be sidelined, the Afghan government compromised and joined the oversight process, in part to keep tabs on it and shape policy along the way. While taking unilateral action has a record of successfully nudging critical allies toward meeting U.S. demands, it can only be applied when the U.S. has the sole capacity to implement the requested policy. It cannot be used, for example, to coerce partners to change their domestic laws or disengage from offensive operations, because those are reforms that the U.S. cannot implement without partner participation. This means the U.S. cannot use this approach to coerce Israel to be more selective with strikes in Gaza. However, Washington can, for example, threaten to unilaterally release detailed information regarding targeting in Gaza to motivate the Israelis to increase transparency and accountability in their campaign. U.S. policymakers can also propose to set up an independent inquiry into civilian deaths in Gaza as a form of oversight and monitoring or use American institutions to address the conflict. The recent U.S. decision to impose financial sanctions on four Israelis who incited violence against Palestinians in the West Bank is a step in this direction. Regarding the current emergency in Gaza, the U.S. can threaten to unilaterally provide humanitarian aid should Israel impede this critical assistance. It can do so, for example, by dispatching a disaster response naval vessel such as the USNS Mercy or USNS Comfort to join the carrier strike groups assigned to the region. Naturally, there will be critics arguing that this measure may undermine Israel\u2019s military campaign, but those positions are too comfortable with Israeli failures to distinguish between Palestinian civilians and Hamas militants. The U.S. can signal its displeasure for the current offensive by offering to help civilians in Gaza secure their basic needs and survival. Sending U.S. unilateral aid to Gaza and informing the Israelis this will happen with or without their cooperation would send three important messages. First, the historical record suggests that a credible threat of unilateral U.S. action can nudge Israel to move closer to U.S. positions to avoid being subverted by the U.S. Second, it boosts U.S. bargaining credibility regionally and reinforces that the U.S. is an autonomous actor in the conflict, as well as a committed Israeli ally. This may be increasingly important as the U.S. may need to press against sustained Israeli occupation of Gaza and strengthen its ties to key Arab partners such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Lastly, unilateral action will allow the U.S. to do more than just lament Palestinian civilian deaths. Just as the U.S. sprang into action to defend Israeli civilians brutally slaughtered on Oct. 7, the U.S. can also spring into action to defend Palestinian civilians currently facing what the U.N. calls \u201capocalyptic\u201d conditions. Like all tools of statecraft, this is only one of many approaches in the U.S. diplomatic toolkit. Even though it is rarely discussed compared to aid conditionality, threatening unilateral policy action to coerce a strategic partner to participate can be more subtle and less risky because it maintains the security alliance and material support for a partner, while also taking issue with specific partner policies. Additionally, threatening unilateral policy implementation in Gaza does not preclude the U.S. from also considering selective aid conditionality or additional pathways of pressure, including reconsidering blocking U.N. action that challenges Israeli positions. Washington will need to be agile and purposeful in its diplomatic approaches as the U.S. seeks to both support and influence Israel\u2014even as its policies, including the offensive in Gaza, violate U.S. interests. The U.S. can and should do more.",

                    "post_content": "The Biden administration is laying the groundwork for an ambitious grand bargain that would tie rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia to substantial steps toward Palestinian statehood, according to nine analysts and former U.S. government officials familiar with the plans. The long-shot diplomatic gamble could remake the Middle East and define U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s foreign-policy legacy, but it faces staggering challenges that many fear will be insurmountable. The plan the administration is working on builds on preexisting efforts to strike a U.S.-Saudi defense pact, a top Saudi foreign-policy priority. In exchange, Saudi Arabia, the most influential Gulf Arab state, would establish diplomatic relations with Israel, with all parties agreeing to forge irreversible steps toward Palestinian statehood. Despite Israel\u2019s punishing war in Gaza, which has drawn widespread condemnation across the Arab world and beyond, Saudi officials never renounced efforts toward normalization. Officials in Washington still see it as the best way to shake up the intractable status quo in a region where decades of U.S.-led peace efforts have failed to bring tensions between Israelis and Palestinians to an end or create a functional, sovereign Palestinian state. Brett McGurk, Biden\u2019s top White House Middle East aide, is spearheading the effort, according to those familiar with the talks, with the administration set to announce the proposed plan in the spring. Diplomatic efforts on the issue were challenging before the war, and they have been exponentially complicated by both the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, which left Israeli society deeply traumatized, and Israel\u2019s brutal offensive in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to complete a Rubik\u2019s Cube while running 100 miles an hour and sinking in quicksand,\u201d Frank Lowenstein, who served as a U.S. special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Obama administration, said of the diplomatic push. \u201cThe degree of difficulty on that is just through the roof.\u201d The challenges were evident last week as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made his fifth visit to the region since the start of the war as part of a multistage diplomatic push by the United States to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages as well as broker a wider deal to diffuse tensions in the region. The visit came as Hamas issued its response to a prospective cease-fire deal, which had been crafted by U.S., Egyptian, Israeli, and Qatari officials and presented to the group late last month. Blinken described the militant group\u2019s demands as containing some \u201cnon-starters\u201d while noting that there was space for further negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Hamas\u2019s proposed terms as \u201cdelusional.\u201d Blinken ultimately came back to Washington without having secured a deal. A moment when the turmoil wrought by Hamas\u2019s attack and Israel\u2019s response has reverberated across the Middle East may seem like an unlikely time for ambitious diplomacy. And analysts and former U.S. officials underscored that no one deal is likely to bring decades of conflict to a close. But some experts say the fact that this crisis is engulfing the region is precisely why now is a good time to try. \u201cEverything is so chaotic. There\u2019s an opportunity to do one grand bargain,\u201d said Joel Braunold, the managing director of the Washington-based S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace. A key element absent from previous peace efforts is the interest of the Gulf Arab states, which have increasingly come to see normalizing ties with Israel as being in their own economic and security interests. \u201cThat\u2019s the new factor here,\u201d said Dennis Ross, who spearheaded U.S. Middle East peace efforts during the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have already signed normalization agreements with Israel as part of the Trump administration-facilitated Abraham Accords. Qatar has emerged in recent years as a significant diplomatic broker, maintaining ties with Hamas\u2019s political wing as well as the United States, and has been central to negotiations over the release of Israeli hostages from Gaza. The promise of normalization with Saudi Arabia would further reduce Israel\u2019s isolation in the Arab world and potentially give Riyadh powerful leverage over Israel to secure concessions for the Palestinians, at least in theory. Both Saudi Arabia and the United States are highly motivated to get a deal done quickly ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. A deal would represent a major diplomatic victory for a president whose foreign-policy record has been plagued by crisis management from Afghanistan to Ukraine to the Middle East. For its part, Saudi Arabia is keen to see a defense pact with the United States make it through the Senate while the Democrats hold the gavel, and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has promised to secure the additional votes needed to reach the two-thirds majority required for ratification of such an agreement, according to NBC News. All the same, the path to clinching the deal is precarious. Biden\u2019s relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is complicated. On the 2020 presidential campaign trail, then-candidate Biden described the Middle Eastern country as a \u201cpariah\u201d state over the brutal murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and once in office, Biden put long-standing U.S.-Saudi ties under review. Now that the United States has done a complete about-face and seems eager for a deal, Riyadh is likely to try to exact a steep price from Washington in exchange for normalizing ties with Israel. In a statement issued this month, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said that there \u201cwill be no diplomatic relations with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state is recognized on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\u201d \u201cSaudi Arabia\u2019s priority in the short term is ending the ongoing violence in Gaza, which requires an immediate cease-fire, the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance,\u00a0and the release of hostages,\u201d said Fahad Nazer, a spokesperson for the Saudi Embassy in Washington, in a statement to\u00a0Foreign Policy. \u201cThat should be followed by a return to a peace process that provides a clear and irreversible pathway to Palestinian statehood.\u201d Relations between the Biden administration and Netanyahu\u2019s government have also become increasingly fraught. Washington is dealing with the farthest-right government in Israeli history, led by a prime minister who has long opposed the creation of a Palestinian state. But \u201cthis is not just a Netanyahu issue\u2014this is an Israeli issue,\u201d said Michael Makovsky, the head of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. \u201cAfter Oct. 7, their whole sense of what they need for their own security has completely changed.\u201d The Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, considered the worst massacre of Jews in a single day since the Holocaust, sent shockwaves through Israeli society and caused tectonic shifts in the Israeli public\u2019s views on Palestinian statehood: 65 percent of Israelis oppose a two-state solution, while only 25 percent support it, recent polls show\u2014a complete reversal of where Israelis stood a decade ago. Foreign Policy\u00a0contacted the Israeli Embassy in Washington for an interview for this piece but was not granted one. It\u2019s also unclear what the Palestinians would get out of such a deal. The United Nations, Arab leaders, and Blinken have all called for irreversible steps toward Palestinian statehood, but U.S. officials have yet to publicly outline what that would entail\u2014and how to make such measures irrevocable. The Biden administration is realistic that full Palestinian statehood remains a distant prospect but is looking into options that could at least help lay the groundwork for a two-state solution, such as land transfers or an agreement on East Jerusalem. Part of that reportedly involves the State Department exploring options for what a \u201cdemilitarized\u201d Palestinian state would look like, though that could be a non-starter for the Palestinian side. Then there\u2019s the matter of who from the Palestinian side would negotiate any path to statehood. The primary political entities that the United States could conceivably negotiate with\u2014the Palestinian Authority and PLO\u2014are \u201cossified and have lost most of their legitimacy,\u201d said Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. \u201cThe PLO barely exists, and the PA is dysfunctional, divided, weak, and deeply unpopular among Palestinians.\u201d Meanwhile, wartime polls show Hamas has gained support among Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank. The Biden administration has spoken of plans to help revitalize the PA, but here, too, it has been light on details on what that plan actually entails. \u201cThere needs to be massive internal reforms before you could even negotiate a final outcome because you need a leadership that has the legitimacy and the mandate to negotiate these existential issues with Israel,\u201d Elgindy said. \u201cThis is one of the main reasons why all the previous negotiations have failed.\u201d In the United States, Biden is facing what promises to be a bruising presidential election campaign against former President Donald Trump with the Israel-Hamas war playing an outsized role in the election cycle. Progressive Democrats have criticized Biden for being too lenient with Israel, while Republicans have rebuked him for not going far enough to support Israel and punish Iran and its regional proxy groups. Congress, meanwhile, is hobbled with partisan infighting and has yet to pass a major national security supplemental bill that includes billions of dollars in funding for Israel. Both Saudi Arabia and Israeli-Palestinian issues have been highly politically charged in Congress in the past. Any new deal could require congressional buy-in, through either funding or a Senate approval of a new defense pact with Saudi Arabia. Clinching any final deal, let alone one during an election year with one of the most dysfunctional Congresses in modern history, could prove to be an impossible task, especially on an expedited timeline ahead of the U.S. elections. \u201cThe idea that this whole deal would be signed, sealed, and delivered within the next three or four months, I just don\u2019t understand how the math works on that,\u201d Lowenstein said. A more feasible alternative, he said, would be for Biden to announce just the parameters of a grand bargain as a road map in the spring.\u00a0 \u201cThat, at least to me, feels relatively feasible.\u201d But if the risks of failure are high, the rewards from the slim chance of success are even higher, administration insiders say\u2014and it\u2019s a chance that Biden administration officials say they can\u2019t let fall by the wayside. Some of the most consequential diplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East came on the backs of war, including the 1978 Camp David Accords that cemented relations between Israel and Egypt after the 1973 war and the 1993 Oslo Accords that effectively set up a vision for a two-state solution after the First Intifada from 1987 to 1993. \u201cWe remain determined as well to pursue a diplomatic path to a just and lasting peace and security for all in the region,\u201d Blinken said during his trip to the region, including a \u201cconcrete, time-bound, irreversible path to a Palestinian state.\u201d Update, Feb. 13, 2024: This piece was updated to include comment from the\u00a0Saudi\u00a0Embassy in Washington.",

                    "post_excerpt": "By omitting Hamas and limiting its case to the crime of genocide, Pretoria lost an opportunity to halt the fighting.",
                    "post_content": "Last week, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a provisional ruling in South Africa\u2019s lawsuit against Israel, it sent an authoritative message to the world: Allegations of genocide against Israel are not meritless. Notwithstanding Hamas\u2019s unlawful conduct that started the war last October, the court clearly indicated an overwhelming disapproval of the way that Israel has been fighting the war\u2014stating, notably, that Palestinians face a \u201creal and imminent risk\u201d to their right to be protected from acts of genocide. Even though the court did not rule on the merits of the genocide allegations, which may take years, it evoked strong reactions from around the globe. While human rights experts and groups welcomed the ruling, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried the court\u2019s decision, protesting the court\u2019s willingness to hear the case at all. In any case, the ICJ decision offers an opportunity for lasting peace that should not be missed. For that, credit must go to South Africa for bringing the case. Pretoria\u2019s \u201cmoral leadership,\u201d as some have called it, has garnered support from many countries throughout the global south. However, other countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States have opposed the lawsuit. Not only has Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, declared South Africa\u2019s case \u201cmeritless,\u201d he\u2019s also argued that the case \u201cdistracts the world\u201d from efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict. While both sides are entitled to their own views, it is wrong to suggest that a case that seeks to stem the bloodbath is an attempt to distract the world from more durable paths to peace at a time when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is threatening to provoke a wider regional war. Since lasting solutions cannot be found within the chambers of the political organs of the United Nations, including the Security Council, which has become hopelessly dysfunctional, solutions must be sought elsewhere. Rather than criticize South Africa for daring to launch the lawsuit that asks whether the Genocide Convention has been violated, a more constructive criticism would be to argue that Pretoria limited its case too narrowly with regard to the parties involved and the scope of its litigation\u2014namely, by not initiating proceedings against Hamas and failing to examine crimes other than genocide, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity, which are often committed under the cover of war. South Africa\u2019s case mainly rests on the principle that international lawyers call obligation erga omnes. According to that doctrine, the obligation to protect human rights and humanity from acts of violence is an obligation owed to the whole world\u2014even if they are not direct victims of said violations. Therefore, any country is entitled to bring legal action to ensure continued protection of the concerned rights , as \u00a0Gambia, Canada, the Netherlands, and Ukraine have done in the past. However, South Africa oddly limited the parties to the proceedings by omitting to initiate proceedings against Hamas, which it could have done by including Palestine as a nominal party in the case. This limitation likely results from the argument that Hamas is not a state actor, and therefore its actions cannot be adjudicated at the ICJ. That argument is flawed. Considering that Hamas is the organization that performs the functions of government in Gaza, a geographic entity forming part of Palestine\u2014which is recognized as a U.N. observer state\u2014it is mistaken to argue that it is not a state actor which could trigger the international responsibility of Palestine. According to the U.N.\u2019s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,\u00a0the conduct of Hamas, as the acting governmental authority in Gaza, is justiciable at the ICJ (just as the conduct of Arizona, a U.S. state, was justiciable at the ICJ in a 2001 case between\u00a0Germany and the United States). Another reason for the limitation likely results from the political debate about Palestine as a state. Given\u00a0that 139 countries have recognized Palestine as a state and the U.N. General Assembly has voted to recognize Palestine\u00a0as a nonmember observer state, the obstacle to initiating proceedings against Palestine at the ICJ depends on the practices of the ICJ. Indeed, Palestine is listed among the states that may be parties to proceedings before the ICJ. Notably, in 2018, the same year it was admitted as a state party to the ICJ statute, Palestine challenged the U.S. relocation of its embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. All this is to say that it might have been preferable for South Africa to initiate proceedings against Hamas, too. Israel had compellingly argued before the ICJ that any provisional order by the court to halt the fighting would tie Israel\u2019s hands and not Hamas\u2019s. That argument offers a better explanation for why the \u00a0ICJ\u2019s ruling did not go as far as to order an immediate cease-fire, though it indicated several provisional measures requiring Israel to prevent acts of genocide. By omitting to include Hamas as a party to ICJ proceedings, South Africa lost the opportunity to actually try to halt the ongoing armed conflict by compelling both sides to stop fighting\u2014given that the Security Council has proved unable to adopt a resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire. South Africa also unduly limited the scope of its litigation by confining it to the question of genocide. World leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, who argued that Israel was entitled to defend itself and go after Hamas, have criticized Israel for indiscriminate bombings that have killed innocent civilians in Gaza, including women and children, in unprecedented numbers in recent history. In its defense, Israel argued that it also found the scale of civilian casualties and destruction in Gaza truly heartbreaking, and that it was doing its best to minimize harm to civilians. This defense was made in spite of the many disturbing utterances of multiple Israeli officials suggesting otherwise, and the critical observations of some Israeli citizens, including soldiers, suggesting a lack of restraint. Still, Israel refused to slow down\u2014insisting at once that it must continue bombing and attacking Gaza until it had eliminated Hamas. The Convention against Genocide is not the only document that Pretoria could have turned to; it could have also cited the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their First Additional Protocol of 1977, a set of treaties which in one form or another bind all nations when fighting wars. The 1949 conventions criminalize the willful killing and willful infliction of great suffering on civilian populations as well as the destruction of civilian property beyond military necessity. The 1977 protocol details the principle of proportionality and forbids indiscriminate attacks. In any war in which there are conflicting accusations and denials about violations of these norms, the legally proper recourse is to pose those questions to the ICJ\u2014just as countries such as the Netherlands and Canada did in their case against Syria about violation of the Convention against Torture. It is unreasonable and fundamentally counterproductive to criticize judicial proceedings before international courts, especially when parties are seeking to intervene in life-and-death situations that the global political institutions have otherwise been unable to resolve. Indeed, no nation should object to using judicial proceedings as a last resort in seeking to stop a war. The irony is inescapable. Since 1928, states have agreed to renounce war as an instrument of state policy and to use peaceful means\u2014including adjudication\u2014to resolve differences instead, an idea subsequently enshrined in the U.N. Charter. Today, there is widespread concern that the ongoing war in Gaza could broaden the conflict across the region or beyond. Given that risk, it is startling that any responsible state would support continuing an armed conflict that has killed so many and destroyed so much, when no effort had been made to use peaceful means of settlement\u2014apart from the brief cease-fire and prisoner exchange last November. Putting the legal merits of these cases aside, there is much value in countries such as Gambia, Canada, the Netherlands, Ukraine, and South Africa bringing these kinds of proceedings to the ICJ. If nothing else, the recent case has forced the international community to confront the problem of armed conflict, even if the only way left to do that is through the international courts. The cases allow judges to cut through all the political noise to answer legal questions. Additionally, such litigation can help to quell the cacophony of recriminations\u2014allegations, denials, and counter-allegations of genocide, war crimes, apartheid, crimes against humanity, and wars of aggression\u2014that these events invariably generate. These lawsuits thus invite trained experts\u2014specifically, highly-qualified judges from across the world, assisted by the briefs and arguments of able counsel\u2014to deliberate these questions and then declare to the world whether there is merit in the allegations, so that they are not left at the level of defamatory political insults or disingenuous denials. International courts now seem to be the last hope for humanity in a world where the possibilities of science have been harnessed by states to maximize destruction, while the U.N.\u2019s ability to curb the scourge of war has largely failed.",

                    "post_content": "For those with long memories, the seed of South Africa\u2019s case against Israel\u2014accusing it of genocidal acts in the Gaza Strip\u2014might be traced to a spring day nearly 50 years ago. On April 9, 1976, South Africa\u2019s white supremacist prime minister, Balthazar Johannes Vorster, was welcomed with full red-carpet treatment to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem. The moment, for those who knew the prime minister\u2019s past, was incongruous. A former Nazi sympathizer who had proudly declared in 1942 that \u201cwe stand for Christian Nationalism which is an ally of National Socialism\u201d bowed his head, knelt, and laid a wreath in memory of Hitler\u2019s victims before his diplomatic entourage whisked him away to more important meetings. Vorster was not in town to make amends for his Nazi past. He was there to cement arms deals with the Israeli government, which had, since 1974, become one of the apartheid regime\u2019s most significant suppliers of military technology. In the years that followed, as many other nations imposed sanctions and distanced themselves from Pretoria, Israel drew closer\u2014supplying the regime with everything from bombs and artillery shells to aircraft components and military training while cooperating on the construction and testing of missile delivery systems and even exchanging materials that were vital to the nuclear weapons programs of both countries. In the dying days of apartheid in the late 1980s, when U.S. sanctions had begun to bite and Pretoria faced a widespread internal uprising and a major war in neighboring Angola and soon-to-be independent Namibia, Israel was a lifeline; so were visits to the front lines from leading Israeli generals and military advisors and the rhetorical support of some of its leaders. Then-Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon urged the West to sell arms to South Africa; former Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Raful Eitan told a university audience in Tel Aviv that \u201c[Blacks] want to gain control over the white minority just like the Arabs here want to gain control over us. And we, too, like the white minority in South Africa, must act to prevent them from taking us over.\u201d Two months after returning from his trip to Israel, Vorster presided over apartheid South Africa\u2019s most infamous massacre, when police opened fire on protesting schoolchildren in Soweto\u2014killing at least 176\u2014many of them shot in the back. None of this was forgotten, especially not last week as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a near-unanimous interim order instructing Israel to take provisional measures to prevent genocidal acts. Relations between Israel and South Africa are now frosty. For South Africa\u2019s current African National Congress (ANC) government, there is no doubt that historical resentment over Israel\u2019s role in prolonging white minority rule and propping up a government that the ANC was fighting to overthrow plays a role. South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid movement and its various liberation movements also have a long history of supporting the Palestinian cause. At a time when Israel was backing Black South Africans\u2019 oppressors, the ANC received support from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It came as no surprise that just two weeks after his release from prison in 1990, Nelson Mandela met with PLO leader Yasser Arafat, declaring, \u201cThere are many similarities between our struggle and that of the PLO. We live under a unique form of colonialism in South Africa, as well as in Israel.\u201d In later speeches, he stated that \u201cour freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.\u201d But there is another reason that South Africa brought the ICJ case when it did: It is desperate to rehabilitate its international image as a moral superpower, a reputation it cultivated during the heady post-apartheid days of the 1990s. But that reputation has been eroded by years of cozying up to authoritarian regimes, failing to condemn human rights violators, and shirking its responsibilities under international law. By daring to take on a radioactive global issue, discussion of which is virtually verboten in Washington but which animates powerful feelings across the Islamic world and far beyond, Pretoria is once again perceived as heroic. Indeed, when wealthy Persian Gulf states were happy to sign (or begin negotiating) agreements with Israel that essentially threw Palestinians under the bus, and larger and more powerful nations that purport to support the Palestinian cause\u2014such as Pakistan and Indonesia\u2014made disapproving noises from the sidelines, South Africa chose to act. It prepared and argued a case before the world\u2019s highest court, challenging Israel\u2014and by extension, its uncritical backers in Washington\u2014to defend itself not in the court of social media and op-ed pages but within the framework of international law in a venue invested with great symbolism and gravitas. Even if the court at this stage has not ruled that Israel engaged in any of the genocidal behaviors alleged by South Africa, its narrow interim finding that \u201cat least some of the acts and omissions alleged by South Africa to have been committed by Israel in Gaza appear to be capable of falling within the provisions of the Convention\u201d has been celebrated as a victory. In some ways, the outcome never really mattered. South Africa\u2019s diplomatic masterstroke was to bring the case at all. For many years after its transition to democracy, South Africa was the recipient of global goodwill\u2014seen as a poster child for peaceful reconciliation and the triumph of good over evil. Many observers assumed that a country that could emerge from such division and brutality intact without widespread bloodshed, ethnic cleansing, or partition surely had something to teach the world. Its Truth and Reconciliation Commission was lauded as a blueprint for other societies healing from the wounds of war. Pretoria offered itself, or was called upon, as a peacemaker. The \u201cRainbow Nation\u201d image brought tourism, international investment, and major global events such as the 2010 FIFA Men\u2019s World Cup. That year, South Africa projected an image of itself as a multiracial melting pot, its citizens blowing joyfully on vuvuzelas in packed stadiums even if the success of the tournament obscured the reality of growing poverty, state corruption, and a violent undercurrent of xenophobia against the many migrants to the country fleeing wars elsewhere in Africa. On the foreign-policy front, South Africa\u2019s moral compass had already started to falter. The ANC government had little to say\u2014behind closed doors or in international forums\u2014when its former ally, Robert Mugabe, plunged neighboring Zimbabwe into crisis by stealing elections in 2002 and subsequent years, attacking his political opposition, and fomenting a refugee crisis that sent over 1 million Zimbabweans across the border to South Africa. Faced with the Syrian government\u2019s brutal crackdown on demonstrators in 2011 that exploded into a subsequent civil war, South Africa abstained in a key U.N. Security Council vote. When the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir in 2015, South Africa refused to seize him when he arrived on South African soil, despite the clamoring of local human rights lawyers\u2014some of whom were in The Hague in January to argue the case against Israel. South Africa\u2019s image as a moral beacon was eroded by years of cozying up to authoritarians, failing to condemn human rights violators, and shirking its responsibilities under international law. The ICC declared two years later that \u201cSouth Africa breached its international and domestic legal obligations when it failed to arrest Al-Bashir. \u2026 South Africa must now put its weight behind international justice which faces increasing global challenges.\u201d Pretoria arguably had such an opportunity when Ukraine brought a case against Russia two days after Moscow invaded in February 2022; more than 30 other nations intervened to support the case. Instead, South Africa\u2019s first public statement from President Cyril Ramaphosa was to thank \u201cHis Excellency President Vladimir Putin\u201d for taking his call and noting South Africa\u2019s \u201cbalanced approach\u201d calling for \u201cmediation and negotiation between the parties.\u201d Ramaphosa\u2019s government is filled with officials nostalgic for the Cold War days when Moscow aided the anti-apartheid movement and many ANC operatives trained in the Soviet Union; many have simply transferred their historical anti-imperialist allegiances to contemporary Russia. The sense of historical debt runs so deep that when Putin\u2014also facing an ICC arrest warrant\u2014planned to visit South Africa for the BRICS summit last August,\u00a0Pretoria formally requested that the ICC exempt it from its legal obligation to arrest him. (Putin later decided not to attend in person.) Then, last November, just after its foreign minister made an official visit to Iran and met with regime officials not exactly known for their commitment to human rights, South Africa welcomed a delegation of Hamas leaders to the country. They met with leading ANC figures and members of the Mandela family while praising the Oct. 7 operation and denying the extent of its brutality. All of this served to bolster the view that South Africa was not just standing up for Palestinian rights, but that it was explicitly embracing a group that celebrated anti-Jewish violence\u2014all of which undermined Pretoria\u2019s effort to cast itself as a potential peacemaker. And just one week before South African lawyers put forth genocide charges against Israel in The Hague, President Cyril Ramaphosa welcomed a well-known genocidaire: Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemeti, who has been leading his Rapid Support Forces in a civil war against the Sudanese Armed Forces for nearly a year. He is better known for commanding the Janjaweed militias in a well-documented genocidal rampage in Darfur between 2003 and 2005 on behalf of Bashir\u2019s government. Yet at a time when Western double standards have been so spectacularly on display, most of the world seems more than happy to let Pretoria\u2019s past and present moral shortcomings slide. Perhaps that\u2019s because, listening to the formal legal proceedings, punctuated by a robed American judge reading out the court\u2019s interim decision in The Hague\u2019s imposing Peace Palace, many Palestinians and their supporters felt genuinely heard for the first time. The United States has, predictably, shrugged off the South African case. Before the proceedings even began, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken argued that the case \u201cdistracts the world\u201d and called it \u201cmeritless.\u201d But irrespective of the case\u2019s legal merits, Blinken\u2019s casual dismissal will have diplomatic consequences\u2014both for the Biden administration\u2019s credibility in promoting its so-called democracy agenda, and when it comes to bolstering support for Ukraine across the global south. As the Brazilian writer Oliver Stuenkel argued recently in Foreign Policy, \u201cMany developing countries see the West\u2019s posture on Israel-Palestine as evidence that it is applying international rules and norms selectively\u2014according to geopolitical interests rather than in a universal fashion.\u201d This suspicion existed long before the current war in Gaza. The perception that Washington and its allies cared about Ukrainian suffering at the hands of an adversary but not Palestinian suffering at the hands of an ally has been a driver of the nonaligned stance adopted by many countries\u2014including Brazil and South Africa. But Israel\u2019s bombardment of Gaza, which has displaced 1.9 million people and killed at least 26,000 has turbocharged this sentiment and made the leaders of many countries far more skeptical of any appeals from Washington or European capitals on humanitarian grounds. The Israel-Palestine issue remains a third rail in British and U.S. politics. (Just this week, a Labour politician in Britain was suspended from the party for suggesting that the bombardment of Gaza amounts to genocide.) But for most of the world, it is fair game. By bringing the case, South Africa has made it acceptable to accuse Israel of grave crimes in a major formal international setting. Moreover, Israel was forced to respond legally rather than rhetorically. Most foreign leaders\u2014and populations\u2014resent the West\u2019s hierarchy of solidarity, which so clearly privileges the victims of its adversaries over those of its allies. Aharon Barak\u2014Israel\u2019s own ad hoc judge in The Hague and a Holocaust survivor\u2014rejected most of South Africa\u2019s arguments. However, he voted with the majority on two of the six provisional measures, ordering Israel to punish rhetoric amounting to incitement and allow basic humanitarian supplies into Gaza. It was a damning outcome for Israel. Then, mere days after the court\u2019s interim ruling, close to one-third of the current Israeli cabinet attended a conference hatching plans to reoccupy an ethnically cleansed Gaza\u2014trampling on their government\u2019s carefully constructed legal defense and gifting South Africa\u2019s lawyers another potential line on their ICJ charge sheet. Because the ICJ lacks enforcement power, U.S. pressure for Israel to act on the ruling\u2019s interim measures is likely the only way they will take effect. The appearance that Washington is simply doing nothing will only reinforce the widely held perception that President Joe Biden\u2019s democracy agenda and all U.S. talk about the sanctity of human rights\u2014from Sudan to China\u2019s Xinjiang\u2014is empty rhetoric. \u201c[T]here is a cost,\u201d wrote Nesrine Malik in the Guardian, \u201cto dismissing concepts and processes that underpin the very legitimacy of these countries\u2019 claim to moral authority.\u201d Most foreign leaders\u2014and populations\u2014outside of Europe and North America now simply don\u2019t take U.S. or European appeals to support Ukraine on humanitarian grounds seriously given the double standard they perceive and their resentment of the West\u2019s hierarchy of solidarity, which so clearly privileges the victims of its adversaries over those of its allies. They are likely to dismiss future moral appeals emanating from Western capitals on similar grounds\u2014no matter how valid or urgent the cause may be. That\u2019s bad news for Darfuris, Rohingyas, Uyghurs, and other victimized minorities; it could also be calamitous in places such as Taiwan or Guyana, should larger saber-rattling neighbors like China and Venezuela choose to make good on threats of war. South Africa, meanwhile, has its eyes on a bigger geopolitical prize. The ICJ case has won it accolades across the global south; governments from Bangladesh to Namibia have formally intervened in support and the ANC government is no longer afraid to publicly contradict and challenge Washington. After hosting the BRICS summit in August, Pretoria made clear that it\u2019s not content to merely follow the anti-Western line set out by Moscow and Beijing. It is seeking to lead the bloc in its own right. After a year in which its credentials as a serious global player were legitimately questioned\u2014over the Putin arrest debate and a major diplomatic spat with Washington over alleged arms shipments to Russia\u2014South Africa has capitalized on the silence and hypocrisy of larger powers in an effort to reclaim its reputation as a moral beacon to the world. Whether deserving of that label or not, it is succeeding.",

                    "post_content": "French Foreign Minister Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) was an accomplished political survivor who managed to serve the French revolutionary government, Napoleon Bonaparte, and the postwar Bourbon restoration. He was a subtle and accomplished statesman, remembered today primarily for his sage advice to his fellow diplomats: \u201cAbove all, not too much zeal.\u201d Wise words, indeed: Overzealousness, rigidity, and excessive moralizing are often obstacles to any effort to find effective solutions to difficult international issues. Unfortunately, political leaders routinely frame disputes with other countries in highly moralistic terms, thereby turning tangible but limited conflicts of interest into broader disputes over first principles. As Anderson University\u2019s Abigail S. Post argued in an important article in the journal International Security last year, leaders engaged in international disputes use moral language to rally support at home and abroad and to enhance their bargaining position vis-\u00e0-vis their adversaries. When they do, disagreements over potentially divisible issues (such as disputed territory) turn into zero-sum conflicts between competing moral claims. Unfortunately, moral principles are hard to abandon or relax without inviting accusations of hypocrisy and charges of betrayal. Once governments use moral arguments to justify their positions, cutting a deal becomes much harder, even when it would be in everyone\u2019s interest. Post\u2019s article illustrated these dynamics with a revealing case study of the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas dispute between Argentina and Great Britain. To back its claim to the islands, each side invoked familiar moral norms. Argentina relied on the norm of territorial sovereignty, and its case was straightforward: Britain had illegally seized the islands in 1833 and therefore should give them back, full stop. The British responded by invoking a different moral principle: the norm of self-determination. In their view, it didn\u2019t matter how Britain had gained control of the islands; as long as a majority of the residents wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom, their preferences should prevail. Once these two positions were firmly established, compromise became nearly impossible. Despite the islands\u2019 limited economic and strategic value, reestablishing control became a potent political issue in Argentina. But British governments could not cede them to Argentina without appearing to abandon a group of British citizens who wanted to remain under British rule. Given these entrenched positions, a military confrontation was probably inevitable. In short: Moral claims transform divisible and potentially solvable disputes into indivisible and much less tractable conflicts. Among other things, this finding suggests an important revision to the so-called bargaining model of war. This framework views most conflicts as being over potentially divisible issues and argues that, rationally, states could reach mutually acceptable solutions if they had perfect information about each other\u2019s capabilities and resolve and could overcome the \u201ccommitment problem\u201d (i.e., the inability to assure others that a deal will be kept). Wars occur because the necessary information is typically lacking and states have incentives to misrepresent it, and fighting is the only way to determine who should get what share of the issue(s) in dispute. Scholars using this framework acknowledge that wars can also arise over indivisible issues where compromise is impossible, but such issues are presumed to be relatively rare. Post\u2019s research suggests that framing disputes in highly moralistic terms transforms divisible issues into indivisible ones, making solutions harder to reach and war more likely.qq Examples of this problem dominate today\u2019s headlines. The present conflict over Taiwan resembles the dispute over the Falklands in certain respects: China claims Taiwan as its sovereign territory by historic right and insists that the past events that left it outside its control should now be reversed. From this perspective, anything short of Taiwan\u2019s full reversion to Chinese sovereignty is unacceptable. By contrast, supporters of Taiwanese autonomy argue that the island\u2019s 24 million inhabitants want to govern themselves and oppose being ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. In this view, restoring Taiwan to Chinese control would violate the political rights of the people who live there. Compromise is difficult because both moral claims have some validity, and anything that falls short of each side\u2019s stated position will immediately be viewed as a betrayal of a fundamental political principle. Now consider how the war in Ukraine is framed by each side. The war arose from a set of concrete and tangible disagreements that were potentially amenable to negotiation and compromise. These issues included Ukraine\u2019s possible entry into NATO; its degree of economic, political, and security integration with Russia and the EU; the status of Russian-speaking minorities within Ukraine; basing rights for the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the supposed role of allegedly neo-Nazi groups within Ukraine; and several others. Difficult issues to be sure, but in theory any or all of them could have been resolved in ways that might have satisfied each side\u2019s core interests and spared Ukraine and Russia a costly and brutal war. Today, however, the conflict is widely framed by each side as a clash between competing moral principles. For Ukraine and the West, what is at stake is the post-World War II norm against conquest, the credibility of the \u201crules-based order,\u201d and the desire to defend a struggling democracy facing a ruthless dictatorship. For Ukrainians, it is a war to defend the nation and its sacred territory; for some of Kyiv\u2019s supporters in the West, helping it win is necessary to uphold the moral principles upon which the Western order supposedly rests. Russia\u2019s justification for the war increasingly rests on moral assertions of its own, such as the accusation that NATO reneged on an earlier pledge not to expand beyond Germany, the claim that there is a deep cultural unity between Russians and Ukrainians that must be preserved, or the insistence that preserving Russian culture requires defending the rights of Russian-speakers in Ukraine and ensuring the permanent \u201cde-Nazification\u201d of Ukraine. One need not accept any of these claims to recognize that they go beyond a mere assertion of narrow strategic interests: Russian President Vladimir Putin and his associates now frame the conflict as essential to preserving Russian national identity (and national security) in the face of hostile foreign pressure. Rhetorically, at least, it is far more than just a quarrel over minority rights in the Donbas or even Ukraine\u2019s geopolitical alignment. Unfortunately, framing this conflict in moral terms makes it harder to reach a peace settlement, because anything short of total victory inevitably invites a powerful backlash from critics fearing that these critical values are being sacrificed. If the United States or NATO were to push Ukraine to cut a deal short of total victory, they would face a chorus of denunciations from those who believe that only a humiliating Russian defeat and Ukraine\u2019s entry into NATO will satisfy the demands of justice. If Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tried to negotiate a cease-fire today, he might well be ousted by hard-liners seeking to fight on. Putin faces fewer internal constraints, but even he might be leery of a compromise at odds with the moral claims he has used to justify the war and retain public support. And then there\u2019s Gaza, the latest unhappy episode in the long conflict between Jews and Arabs that began when Zionist settlers began arriving in Palestine in the late 19th century. As with Ukraine, there are numerous tangible issues involved in this dispute, and there have been repeated efforts (beginning well before Israel\u2019s founding) to find some sort of solution. Unfortunately, the two sides\u2019 positions ultimately rest on competing moral claims to the territory lying between the river and the sea, claims that combine one-sided historical narratives, religious beliefs, and firm conviction that the other side has committed numerous crimes in the past and continues to do so today. These competing moral claims inspire extreme responses by Hamas and by the Israelis, and they have made it far more difficult to devise a solution that would satisfy the legitimate national aspirations of Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs. Americans are as susceptible to this problem as anyone. Realists like Hans Morgenthau and George Kennan lamented the tendency of American leaders to frame every rivalry in moral terms, which they correctly saw as a serious impediment to a more effective foreign policy. Moral language can be useful for rallying citizens and winning support, but it makes the United States look hypocritical whenever it acts otherwise, which turns out to be quite often. It also makes it harder for U.S. officials to bargain effectively with potential adversaries, either because we refuse to have diplomatic relations with them, or because even a mutually beneficial deal with a supposedly \u201cevil\u201d regime is seen as a cowardly failure to uphold key moral principles. But let\u2019s not kid ourselves: In the end, conflicts often conclude in messy and morally imperfect bargains. Even after one-sided victories, the winners often settle for somewhat less than their moral justifications would require. The United States demanded and got \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d in World War II, for example, only to tolerate (and in some cases, actively support) the reentry of former Nazis into political life. It held war crimes trials in Japan and executed some former Japanese leaders but left Emperor Hirohito on his throne. U.S. leaders weren\u2019t happy watching the Iron Curtain descend in Eastern Europe after the war, but they understood that accepting Soviet domination there was the price of postwar peace. The conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine will end with agreements that won\u2019t satisfy anyone completely. None of the parties will get everything they want, and the strident moral declarations that leaders and pundits have issued while these wars were underway will ring hollow. The longer the participants cling to them, the harder it will be to bring the carnage to a close. If Talleyrand were alive today, I suspect he\u2019d say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d",

                    "post_content": "In Ehud Olmert\u2019s first major policy address as acting Israeli prime minister in 2006, he backed the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Since then, Olmert has been on the front lines of advocating for a two-state solution, overseeing the end of Israel\u2019s 2006 Lebanon War and 2008 Gaza War as well as negotiating with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that were just short of a lasting peace. More than 15 years later, Israel is facing another two-front conflict. But this time, Olmert\u2019s longtime rival, Benjamin \u201cBibi\u201d Netanyahu, is at the helm. Foreign Policy sat down with Olmert on the sidelines of the Aspen Ideas Festival to discuss Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities, Olmert\u2019s postwar proposal for Gaza, Israel\u2019s relations with the United States and the Arab world, and the unraveling of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Alexandra Sharp: If you had to name one thing, what would you say is the greatest threat to Israel\u2019s future right now? Ehud Olmert: The weakening of the solidarity within the Israeli society about what should be our national priorities: to end the war [in Gaza], to move forward into political solutions for outstanding wars with or threats of wars or hostilities with the Palestinians and [with Hezbollah] in the north, and to move forward to be part of a very important bloc of [Arab] countries which were traditionally our enemies but which can be our partners. AS: Do you believe that a full-scale war with Hezbollah is imminent? Is it even a good idea for Israel to be conducting this sort of war right now? EO: I think that this is reckless provocation. If there will be a comprehensive all-out war between us and Hezbollah, there will not be Hezbollah and probably not Lebanon after it. But [Israel] will also suffer a great deal, more than we have suffered up until now in all of the different wars that we had\u2014in terms of civilian centers, not in terms of armies\u2014because [Hezbollah] will be shooting at longer distances into the center of Israel. Hezbollah does have this capacity. We are fully aware of that, but I am not certain that they are anxious to stretch it to the point where they will try to use all of [their weapons]. That they feel that they can use it has more power than the actual use of it because once you use it, it\u2019s used. You can\u2019t threaten anymore. Therefore, there should be an alternative, and there is an alternative. And the alternative is an agreement between Israel and the Lebanese government about the outstanding disputes concerning the border between Israel and Lebanon, which will imply some adaptations on the territorial issues in the north in return for a withdrawal of Hezbollah from the borderline. I prefer up until the Litani River line. That\u2019s what we did in 2006. And I think that the concept of this is that it provides Hezbollah with the appearance of an achievement that, from their point of view, can be shown as a very significant, tangible achievement as a result of their participation in the war. For the Israeli side, it will not be an appearance of great victory, but it will provide the necessary circumstances for the residents of the north to return back to their homes, which is of very important interest for Israel. Netanyahu needs the appearance of a big achievement. He needs, miraculously, something that will keep him alive. Alive means in power, unchallenged, valuable. AS: How close is Netanyahu to losing control? Can we see a snap election coming to Israel? EO: My guess is at the end of the year, beginning of the next year, there will be elections. I guess that if there will not be a solution [to the war]\u2014and there is not likely to be a solution soon\u2014then the religious parties will probably break the coalition. A hostage deal at this point means the end of the war. The end of the war means that all hell will break loose the day after the exchange and that [Netanyahu] may lose the majority for his government. So, when he says we will end the war, we\u2019ll move all of our forces to the north\u2014 yeah, by when will we end the war? He doesn\u2019t say, and he doesn\u2019t specify, and he doesn\u2019t give any benchmark to have a rough idea of what time it can be. It\u2019ll be another year for him. AS: You wrote an article recently in Haaretz where you talked about the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. Is that something that is imminent? EO: Absolutely, it\u2019s imminent. Is Netanyahu\u2019s plan prepared to do it? No. At the end, someone, probably someone else, will do it, but it will have to be done. Look, I will not pretend to say that I know what [Hamas leader] Yahya Sinwar thinks. But I know one thing. He holds in his hands the assets which are crucial for Israel. And I understood that had I been in a similar position, probably I would have not given [those assets] up unless I will get the only thing that really matters for me, which is the end of the war. So, Israel has to decide what is more important: to kill a few more terrorists, to lose more lives of Israeli soldiers, and possibly also to lose all the hostages. Or to say we reached a point where the continued military operation is not worth the cost. AS: Is there still a future in this climate for a true two-state solution? EO: It\u2019s a very simple idea. It\u2019s very difficult and complex and sensitive to accomplish, to implement it. Let\u2019s assume [Israel] will do what no one thinks we can, which is to destroy completely Hamas. You can\u2019t destroy completely a terrorist organization. You can weaken them dramatically, as we did. They lost thousands of their soldiers, and they lost most of their tonnage and most of their weapons and most of the launchers and most of the command positions and whatnot. But now, let\u2019s assume for the sake of our discussion, that we can do it. No Palestinian Hamas. No one will remain alive. There are still 6 million Palestinians. What are we going to do with the 6 million Palestinians? Is Israel anxious to continue to be an occupier forever? Is it possible? Is it not going to cost Israel the price of pain, of isolation, of boycott, of rejection? So, if there is an alternative political solution that will release Israel of the occupation, I\u2019m ready to discuss it. But I haven\u2019t heard from anyone that may propose to me, \u201cOK, not a two-state. Something else that will not imply a continued Israeli occupation of 6 million people.\u201d So, there is no alternative. There is only one solution. The question is: Will Israel have the power and determination, the vision and the leadership to move forward? And will the Palestinians have the leadership and the vision and the strength to overcome their differences and to embark on meaningful negotiations? It will happen. The question is whether it will happen sooner or whether we\u2019ll have to pay in blood and they will have to pay in blood. But we are not going to pull out from Gaza, and [the United States] will not urge us to pull out from Gaza, unless there is an alternative force that would prevent Hamas from returning into any kind of government position. AS: And what would that force be? EO: Preferably Palestinian and moderate Arab countries that will take over. For me, Gaza is not Israel. Gaza is Palestinian. Let them run it. However, if they can\u2019t build up a security force that will be effective, then for a period of time until it will be built, there has to be another force. And the only other force is an international intervention force from Europe, something that we did in the south of Lebanon in 2006. We did it, and it was very successful. It helped create an environment that prevented Hezbollah from shooting into Israel for more than 17 years. And I personally think that Israel would be interested in being part of this international force of rebuilding Gaza because we never had any feud with the people of Gaza. They are the victims of the war, which was imposed by their own people. But if we can be of some help in order to resurrect and rehabilitate Gaza, we should also be part of it. I proposed to the Palestinian Authority in 2008 a comprehensive agreement on the basis of the [19]67 borders, where Israel will be allowed as part of the agreement anything between 4.4 and 5 percent of the territory of the West Bank. But Israel will agree to swap territories that were part of the state of Israel prior to \u201967 to the Palestinian state so that, territorial-wise, the size of the Palestinian state will be equal to \u201967. I propose that all the Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem will be part of a Palestinian state that will be the capital of the Palestinian state. I propose that the Holy Basin, the Old City of Jerusalem, will have no sovereignty of any country, not Israeli and not Palestinian, and that it will be administered by trusteeship of five nations: Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and America under U.N. Security Council authorization. And that the issue of the Arab refugees will be resolved within the framework of the Arab League peace initiative. AS: Is there any concern about declining U.S. public support for Israel and that affecting Israel\u2019s military or even diplomatic actions? EO: I wrote an article in Haaretz where I say that Bibi [Netanyahu] is determined to destroy the relations between Israel and America because he believes that it can somehow strengthen his status with his political base. \u201cAll the world is against us, and Bibi\u2019s the only guy who has the guts and the power and the determination to face the whole world,\u201d which he thinks may help him with his supporters. This is not between America and Israel. This is between Bibi and the rest of the world. The relationship between Israel and America is great. And we don\u2019t have any reason to complain about [U.S. President Joe] Biden. I mean, what he has been doing to me is admirable. Netanyahu thinks that he can fool the world, and the reason that the American reaction is not tougher and harsher and more aggressive is because of the deep commitment of President Biden to the state of Israel, to the people of Israel. But there will be a point where [tensions] may erupt and Israel may be forced to pay a price that will be very costly. AS: There are U.S. efforts to restart normalizing diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Are we likely to see a turn to friendlier Israeli-Arab nation relations in the near future? EO: We have peace agreements with four Arab countries. Now, the whole strategy of President Biden, which I entirely agree with, to change the balance in the Middle East is to create a new axis of all the moderate Arab countries, and that includes Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Israel and a Palestinian state. So that will create a certain new bloc of countries that are cooperating together. Now, the crown prince in Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, is very much in favor of this. But they can\u2019t move forward to do it unless there is some kind of movement on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, because [Riyadh is] concerned that without some kind of a rapprochement between us and the Palestinians, that public opinion in those countries\u2014even though they are not precisely democracies\u2014the public opinion of the Muslims in those countries can erupt in opposition in a way that they don\u2019t want to have to deal with. AS: If you were in Netanyahu\u2019s shoes right now, what would you do differently? EO: Look, Netanyahu is a failure. [U.S. commentator] Tom Friedman said that he\u2019s the worst leader the Jewish people ever had in the history of the Jewish people. We have a long history, so you have to be exceptional to be the worst. There was a very interesting and a very, very powerful relatively short article on [Saturday] in the Hebrew edition of Haaretz by a well-known writer in Israel who used to be a very intimate friend of Netanyahu\u2019s. He repeats what Friedman says: [Netanyahu] will not stop before he destroys the state of Israel. He doesn\u2019t care for the people of Israel. He despises them because they don\u2019t understand his greatness and because they don\u2019t understand that only he can guide them and can lead them. Look, I think that Netanyahu\u2019s really a shallow person. That\u2019s what I thought about him from the day that we met. I never changed my mind. We were in the same party. We were in the same cabinet for a while, and then I replaced him with a minister of finance. But I never had any personal relations other than the formal relations that were part of being in the same government, in the same party. I never trusted him. And I think I was right.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The country\u2019s relationship with Lebanon hasn\u2019t moved beyond decades-old dilemmas.",
                    "post_content": "Whoever \u201cthey\u201d are, they often say, \u201cEverything old is new again.\u201d That seems indisputable when it comes to pop culture. One of my daughters listens to classic rock, and she isn\u2019t an outlier among her friends. Both kids dig 90s television, and I am told that pants cuffs and three-button suit jackets will be making a comeback soon. It is not just music, television, and fashion, however. The same \u201cold is new\u201d phenomenon is also true about the Middle East. Many of the ideas that policymakers and the foreign-policy community have put forward to resolve the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians after the war between Israel and Hamas comes to an end are based on initiatives proffered in the second half of the 20th century\u2014or even before then. Israel\u2019s leaders have mostly ignored these proposals. Yet there is an undeniable \u201cback to the future\u201d quality to their own approach to security. Even if the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) do not establish a full-blown military administration in the Gaza Strip, it is likely that Israel is going to occupy parts of the territory\u2014a reversal of the withdrawal it carried out in August 2005. And, as the Israelis turn their attention to their northern border and Lebanon, they may be embarking on a military operation that will likely put them back where they were on May 23, 2000\u2014the day before Israeli military forces withdrew from southern Lebanon after 28 years. Both policies would pose political dilemmas for which Israel has never found lasting solutions. By the turn of the 21st century, Israel was confronted with at an impasse with Lebanon. It had invaded its northern neighbor almost three decades prior in an attempt to bring peace to the Galilee. It achieved that objective, but at a significant cost. The Israelis remained in Lebanon for almost three decades\u2014for the last 25 years maintaining a 328 square mile security zone in the country\u2019s south that they patrolled along with allied militias, notably including the South Lebanon Army (SLA). In those years, the Israelis lost about\u00a0300 soldiers\u00a0and spent billions maintaining their presence and ensuring the capabilities of their proxy forces. When he became prime minister in 1999, the Labor Party\u2019s Ehud Barak\u2014Israel\u2019s most decorated soldier\u2014promised Israelis that he would withdraw from the security zone. He\u00a0made the case\u00a0that Israel\u2019s investment in southern Lebanon was hardly worth it. From Barak\u2019s perspective, the IDF\u2019s presence gave militant group Hezbollah and Syria a golden opportunity to bog it down and draw as much Israeli blood as possible. It was only bureaucratic inertia resulting from fiercely held differences about the value of the mission among the IDF high commander that had locked the Israelis in a policy that left their forces vulnerable. Once Barak made the decision to withdraw, however, the Israelis were so eager to get out of Lebanon that they left five weeks earlier than planned.\u00a0Since then, there has been one major conflict with Hezbollah (in 2006) and too many skirmishes to count, not including the daily exchange of fire since the war in Gaza began more than nine long months ago. Up until Oct. 7, 2023, the Israelis seemed reasonably confident that they could continue to secure their border by deterring Hezbollah and its Iranian patrons through the timely and judicious use of force in Lebanon; Syria; and at times, Iraq and even Iran. This shadow war was successful, but there were worrying signs before Hamas\u2019s attack that Israel\u2019s deterrent was weakening. Hezbollah\u2019s leaders sent their forces right down on the Israeli border, and the group\u2019s militants periodically tried to infiltrate Israel from both above and below ground. Since Hamas\u2019s attack last fall, the Israelis have reconsidered their tolerance for Hezbollah\u2019s provocations. Fearing that the Lebanese group would stage an assault on Israel\u2019s northern communities akin to what Hamas carried out, Israeli authorities evacuated 80,000 civilians from the area. This situation is intolerable for Israelis. Of course there is hardship for those who have left their homes, but as long as they are gone, Hezbollah has effectively rendered Israel\u2019s sovereignty over its own territory an open question. As a result, Israel is determined to change the status quo. Principle among its concerns is pushing Hezbollah back to the Litani River, which runs parallel to the Israel-Lebanon border, located about 18 miles north of it. This is consistent with U.N. Security Council\u00a0Resolution 1701,\u00a0 a 2006 document that, among other things, requires that Hezbollah be dismantled and prohibits forces other U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese Army from operating south of the Litani. Fearing a devastating conflict, the Biden administration has been hard at work\u2014with the French government along for the ride\u2014trying to find a diplomatic solution to the issue. It is a heavy lift. Hezbollah has\u00a0thrown cold water\u00a0on any agreement that would require it to withdraw. And the Israelis are not willing to accept an agreement on paper\u2014like Resolution 1701\u2014but would instead\u00a0require an actual Hezbollah withdrawal.\u00a0For either side to concede would amount to a strategic defeat. That makes escalation more likely. Setting aside what is likely to be a shattering war that will lay waste to significant portions of both countries, the same question that has bedeviled the IDF in Gaza\u2014what comes next?\u2014beckons in southern Lebanon. Assuming that they prevail\u2014not a forgone conclusion\u2014the Israelis have no clear way forward once the fighting stops. Like in Gaza, there is no authority to whom to hand off territory once it is cleared. Israel\u2019s proxies in southern Lebanon collapsed long ago. A quick Israeli withdrawal would likely result in the return of Hezbollah, rendering the conflict strategically meaningless for Israel. Meanwhile, a lot of blood would have been expended. No doubt, Israel\u2019s leaders want to avoid that outcome, but their options are limited. Even with its firepower, the IDF is unlikely to eliminate Hezbollah\u2019s threat. With no partners on the ground, a feckless U.N., an ineffective Lebanese army, and zero prospect of getting help from NATO peacekeepers, the Israelis may very well turn back the clock to establish a security zone in southern Lebanon. The Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon are quite different in terms of the political, diplomatic, and specific security challenges that Israelis confront in each place. Yet, Hamas\u2019s October 2023 attack against Israel and Hezbollah\u2019s ability to compromise the country\u2019s sovereignty are making the case for Israelis that the withdrawals of the early 2000s have not brought Israel peace, but rather, the opposite. It is an argument that Israel\u2019s right wing was making at the time. It is now more potent than ever. Analysts and policymakers should not be surprised if the future of Gaza and southern Lebanon looks eerily similar to the recent past.",

                    "post_excerpt": "A tense showdown risks spiraling out of control.",
                    "post_content": "A pair of high-profile assassinations has pushed the Middle East closer to the brink of a wider regional war and upended high-stakes cease-fire and hostage negotiations over the war in Gaza. Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s top political leader, were killed in separate strikes this week in Beirut and Tehran, respectively, dealing a significant blow to the two militant groups and their benefactors in Iran. Israel is reported to be behind the killing of both, raising the risk of a wider war between Israel and Iran with its proxy forces. \u201cHezbollah, and now Iran, will likely now have to retaliate,\u201d said Michael Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. \u201cThis is the closest the region has been to an all-out conflict in the last 10 months,\u201d he added. Indeed, on Wednesday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reportedly ordered Iran to strike Israel directly in response to Haniyeh\u2019s killing on Iranian soil. U.S. officials, lawmakers, and analysts said neither Israel nor Iran is seeking a full-scale war, which could be orders of magnitude deadlier than Israel\u2019s current war in Gaza against Hamas. But that alone may not prevent one. \u201cIf any war happens, it\u2019s not going to be because of a deliberate declaration of war; it\u2019s going to happen because of things spiraling out of control,\u201d said Bilal Saab, an expert on U.S.-Middle East security issues with Trends Research and Advisory, a consulting group. \u201cBoth sides, Israel and the Iran-led axis, do not want such a war, but it\u2019s the ultimate paradox because they continue to pursue provocative acts that are getting us closer and closer to war.\u201d The latest round of escalations comes as steadfast U.S. support for Israel, a mainstay of U.S. foreign policy for decades, is eroding in the Democratic Party. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces mounting frustration and backlash from Democratic lawmakers over how Israel has carried out its war in Gaza. Human rights groups charge that Israel has indiscriminately bombed Palestinian civilians and fueled a humanitarian crisis by at times blocking aid from entering Gaza. An estimated 39,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to data from the Palestinian health authority in the Hamas-controlled government. Israel counters that it has sought to limit civilian casualties throughout its war and that Hamas purposefully constructs its military infrastructure under civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals, to put civilians in the crosshairs. Haniyeh\u2019s killing could deal a blow to ongoing but as-yet fruitless efforts by mediators from the United States, Egypt, and Qatar to reach a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas and push the latter to release the hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel that sparked the war. Haniyeh, head of Hamas\u2019s political arm based in Qatar, was viewed as the international face of the militant group and took part in cease-fire and hostage negotiations. \u201cIt makes it much more challenging right now in regards to the hostage negotiations, and it makes a hot situation even hotter,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an influential proponent of U.S.-Israel ties in Congress. However, analysts said Haniyeh had limited influence within Hamas and that the final decision for any cease-fire and hostage deal ultimately rests with the group\u2019s top leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, who has so far eluded Israeli authorities. Top Biden administration officials have urged all parties to de-escalate as Washington and other interlocutors scramble to salvage the ongoing talks. \u201cRight now, the path that the region is on is toward more conflict, more violence, more suffering, more insecurity,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday during a press conference in Mongolia, where he is on a multi-country tour of the Indo-Pacific. \u201cAnd to get there, it also first requires all parties to stop taking any escalatory actions.\u201d Most U.S. and regional officials expect Tehran to retaliate against Israel for Haniyeh\u2019s assassination, which revealed serious flaws in Iran\u2019s security operations. Haniyeh was reportedly killed by a remote-controlled bomb that was snuck into a Tehran guesthouse where he is known to stay when in Iran approximately two months ago\u2014well before his visit to the country this week to attend Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian\u2019s inauguration. The New York Times reports that Iran\u2019s military leaders are considering a combined drone and missile attack targeting military sites near Tel Aviv and Haifa, perhaps as part of a coordinated operation that could also include strikes from Iranian proxy groups in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Some officials and analysts predict that Iran\u2019s response will be similar to the broad attack it launched against Israel in April that featured a barrage of ballistic missiles and drones. Such an attack could indicate that Tehran is carefully calibrating its reaction to not trigger a wider war. Most of the missiles and drones in that attack were easily intercepted by Israel\u2019s Iron Dome system and other air defenses throughout the Middle East coordinated by U.S. Central Command, helping avert costly strikes that could spiral into a wider war. \u201cIran will have to think very carefully about what they do next,\u201d said Kenneth McKenzie, a retired U.S. Marine general and the head of Central Command until 2022. \u201cI don\u2019t know if escalation is inevitable.\u201d While Iran has promised to respond within 48 hours, McKenzie said that Tehran\u2019s past record of retaliation doesn\u2019t indicate that it\u2019s married to that timeline. And in lieu of directly striking inside of Israel, Iran could take a less escalatory option, such as an attack against Israeli assets outside of the region. As for Israel, it has vowed to kill all of Hamas\u2019s leaders following the group\u2019s Oct. 7 attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis. In addition to the recent killings of Shukr and Haniyeh, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed on Thursday that a July airstrike in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip killed Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas\u2019s military wing. Israel said that Shukr, the Hezbollah commander who was killed, was responsible for the rocket attack in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights that killed 12 children over the weekend. He is also alleged to have had a role in the 1983 bombing of a military barracks in Beirut that killed more than 240 U.S. troops. Israel has refused to comment on any involvement in Haniyeh\u2019s death, but Netanyahu gave a defiant speech at the IDF\u2019s headquarters in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, saying Israel had killed Shukr and warning that \u201cIsrael will exact a very heavy price for any aggression against us.\u201d Yet experts warn that Israel\u2019s military, which is still actively fighting its war in Gaza, could face being overwhelmed if the war expanded to a full-scale conflict with Hezbollah or Iran. Such a war would be \u201ca whole different ball game,\u201d said Jonathan Lord, a U.S. Middle East policy expert with the Center for a New American Security. Experts believe Israel would have difficulty sustaining combat operations against Hezbollah, which has significantly more fighters and arms than Hamas and extensive tunnel networks under Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel. Israel\u2019s active-duty military is a little less than a third of the size of Iran\u2019s, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based military think tank.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The top court\u2019s historic declaration is a major boon to the Palestinian solidarity movement.",
                    "post_content": "Last month, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a historic advisory opinion declaring Israel\u2019s ongoing occupation of Palestinian territory\u2014comprising the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip (together the Occupied Palestinian Territory, or OPT)\u2014to be illegal under international law. The ICJ opinion also called for the immediate and total withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the OPT. Given Israeli and U.S. intransigence, the nonbinding decision is unlikely to change the course of the current war and will do little to prevent the imminent regional conflagration. But it will have profound diplomatic and political implications beyond this moment and is a major boon to the Palestinian solidarity movement\u2019s program of isolating Israel on the international stage. Whether it alters U.S. policy in the near term, particularly in the event of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019s electoral victory, is a question of political will: Though the Biden administration claims to abide by international law and has already declared Israeli settlements illegal, it has declined to use the ample leverage at its disposal to pressure Israel into compliance. The 83-page advisory opinion came in response to a request from the U.N. General Assembly, which in a December 2022 resolution asked the court to opine on the legality of Israel\u2019s occupation and the consequent ongoing denial of Palestinian rights. The opinion is the second time the top international court has taken up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (A third, South Africa\u2019s case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, is ongoing.) In 2004, the ICJ, in an advisory opinion, declared that the border wall Israel erected loosely following the Green Line separating Israel proper and the West Bank\u2014including significant incursions into the OPT\u2014violated international law and must be torn down. However, this is the first instance in which the court addressed the legality of the occupation as such. What did the ICJ advisory opinion establish?\u00a0 The opinion began by determining the legal status of the territory in question, holding that East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza have all been under Israeli occupation since 1967. The pronouncement reaffirmed that despite Israel\u2019s 2005 withdrawal of settlers from Gaza, it has retained direct economic and military control of the area\u2019s land, sea, and air borders and regulates the inflows and outflows of goods and people. This has been especially true since Hamas\u2019s attack on Oct. 7, 2023, with Israel obstructing the flow of aid into Gaza. Thus, Israel retains its obligations as an occupying power over the whole of the OPT, which arise from the Fourth Geneva Convention, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), and other treaties. Next, the court determined that Israel\u2019s practice of transferring settlers into the OPT along with civilian infrastructure is an attempt to integrate settlements into the territory of Israel in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The court noted that by 2023, nearly 700,000 settlers resided in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. This is a drastic increase from approximately 520,000 settlers in 2012\u2014in the first six months of 2023, Israel advanced a record-breaking 12,855 new settler housing units across the West Bank. The opinion also found Israel\u2019s regular diversion of natural resources and the displacement of Palestinians in the OPT (the court notes the displacement of thousands of Palestinians in the past three years alone) to be a violation of international law. Finally, the court determined that Israel\u2019s regime of comprehensive restrictions on Palestinians throughout the OPT constitutes systematic discrimination under the relevant human rights treaties. Taken together, the court declared that these policies and practices represent a violation of the Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-determination\u2014a right the court had already established in its 2004 advisory opinion. Responding to the second question posed by the General Assembly, the court ruled that Israel\u2019s occupation is illegal and that it is obligated to withdraw from the OPT and transfer the settlers residing there into Israel proper. The court also added that Israel must provide reparation for the damage caused by its illegal acts to the affected Palestinians, including returning land and other confiscated property and allowing the reentry of those who have been displaced since 1967. Lastly, the court declared that states and international organizations have a duty not to recognize the occupation as legal and to work to bring Israel\u2019s unlawful presence in the OPT to an end. However, it left to the other bodies of the United Nations\u2014namely, the General Assembly and the Security Council\u2014the task of determining what specific actions to that end are required. What impact could the opinion have? The opinion is a significant step forward in the long struggle for Palestinian self-determination. In essence, it supports a growing international consensus that the state of Palestine already exists de jure despite its actual creation as a sovereign entity being materially impeded by Israel\u2019s belligerent occupation. This marks a conceptual displacement of the Oslo paradigm, according to which a Palestinian state can only be achieved through U.S.-mediated bilateral negotiations\u2014the so-called peace process\u2014which, marred from the outset by power imbalances, has been abandoned by a succession of increasingly right-wing Israeli governments. However, it is important to note that the opinion excludes acknowledgement of the Nakba, the forced displacement of more than 700,000 Palestinians from their ancestral lands in 1948, thus declining to address the long-standing Palestinian demand for a right of return for those displaced and their descendants. More pressingly, the decision is unlikely to meaningfully alter Israel\u2019s ongoing genocidal war in Gaza or prevent the rapidly accelerating threat of a regional war. Israel has already flouted binding legal dictates from the U.N. Security Council and the ICJ itself, vis-\u00e0-vis South Africa\u2019s case, both of which directly ordered it to end the war. But so long as it sustained the diplomatic and military backing of its chief sponsor, the United States, the Israeli leadership has calculated that it can continue its campaign, the law be damned. But there is some hope. In the medium term, the impact of the decision will be felt as states alter their foreign policies so as to conform with the requirements of international law. In practice, the decision portends the further isolation of Israel on the international stage through targeted sanctions against settlers, embargoes on goods produced in the OPT, and other diplomatic actions such as public condemnation. Already, the Labour government in the United Kingdom, one of Israel\u2019s principal allies, is reportedly considering an arms embargo against the state as a consequence of the advisory opinion. Nine nations\u2014including Ireland, Norway, and Spain\u2014have recognized the state of Palestine since October, and this and other formal legal processes will accelerate that trend. How was the ruling received? Since its release, the ICJ opinion has garnered mixed reception. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki has called it a \u201cwatershed moment for Palestine, for justice, and for international law,\u201d whereas Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has condemned the ruling as \u201cmendacious,\u201d with Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich even calling to formally annex the West Bank. Though the U.S. State Department issued an ambivalent statement, affirming that \u201cIsrael\u2019s program of government support for settlements is \u2026 inconsistent with international law,\u201d it criticized the breadth of the court\u2019s opinion. Washington\u2019s unequivocal backing of Israel is the key impediment to Palestinian self-determination and regional peace. This ruling, in addition to South Africa\u2019s ongoing genocide case against Israel at the ICJ and forthcoming criminal prosecutions at the International Criminal Court, can provide a basis for an incoming Harris administration to condition that support on Israel\u2019s compliance with its obligations under international law. In practice, this would mean telling the Israelis that unless they follow the law, the United States will pause all arms shipments and decline to veto enforcement resolutions at the U.N. Security Council. Although insufficient, these steps are likely necessary ones on the path to breaking the U.S.-Israel alliance and achieving justice for Palestinians.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Even after buying their way out of Gaza, Palestinians remain vulnerable.",
                    "post_content": "CAIRO\u2014Although Egypt has refused to accept refugees from the Gaza Strip, more than 100,000 Palestinians have crossed the border into Egypt since the start of Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza following Hamas\u2019s attack on Oct. 7, 2023. Khaled Shabir, a 29-year-old man, is one of the Palestinians who managed to flee. He entered Egypt in March, four months after the Israeli army bombed his house in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis. The attack killed his parents, but he survived with crushed bones in his foot, thigh, and hand, which landed him in a hospital and then a field medical facility. Some Palestinians are able to get a free medical transfer to Egypt for life-threatening conditions. But Shabir had to go the route of most who have fled: paying Hala Consulting and Tourism, the only company that secures passage from Gaza into Egypt. Hala, whose owner reportedly has close ties with the Egyptian authorities, charges $2,500 to $5,000 per person crossing over\u2014much more than most Palestinians can afford. Shabir did not have the money. But with a crowdfunding campaign, he was able to raise $5,000 to cross into Egypt. \u201cDoctors at the hospital were sympathetic to my condition and waived their financial fees for my surgeries,\u201d he wrote in a text message from his hospital bed in Cairo on June 4. Like most Palestinians who have recently arrived in Egypt, Shabir has found himself in a strange position: Because he is not technically a refugee, he isn\u2019t eligible for most international aid for refugees, unlike his counterparts back in Gaza. Eight Palestinians in Egypt interviewed for this story said they hadn\u2019t received any humanitarian relief from international organizations. This has left them dependent on the goodwill of others\u2014and increasingly at risk of being unable to get by. Palestinians who have fled are reaching Egypt at a time when the country is experiencing its worst economic crisis in decades. In recent years, Egypt\u2019s inflation rates have reached all-time highs, rent and food prices have soared, and millions of people have fallen into poverty. It is especially difficult for Palestinians to navigate Egypt\u2019s crisis. The majority of recent arrivals do not have official residency documents, so they cannot enroll their children in public school, apply for jobs, or receive health care and other benefits, according to an official from the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo who spoke with Foreign Policy on the condition of anonymity. The official said on June 30 that just three international organizations have provided assistance to Palestinians who have fled to Egypt, and it has only reached a small portion of them. This aid includes $200 from the Islamic World Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for 500 students, as well as medical and psychological care from Save the Children and UNICEF for a few injured infants. Even for those with more resources, life has grown tough as their savings have run low. Nagham, a 23-year-old college student majoring in commerce, left Gaza at the end of January to stay with relatives in Cairo after the Israeli military destroyed her home and her husband\u2019s barber shop. Because she had residency papers and was already enrolled at Cairo University, Nagham\u2014who preferred to use only her first name\u2014did not have to pay for entry. (Before the war, she studied online and only went to Cairo for exams.) But after arriving in Cairo, Nagham had to sell her wedding ring and other jewelry to raise the funds needed to pay transit fees to bring her husband to safety. Now, she said, \u201cwe\u2019re in a really bad financial situation.\u201d As of April, she was being treated for a cervical infection she contracted from contaminated water in the first few months of the war. In May, Nagham sought financial aid from the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo, but it did not provide any help. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), meanwhile, included her name in a registry tallying the number of Palestinians in Egypt, but she is not sure whether this implies any forthcoming aid. \u201cWe\u2019re starting over from scratch,\u201d Nagham said. \u201cI feel like we are in a nightmare.\u201d Kamel Mohamed, a 23-year-old who left Gaza in April, said that the majority of university students he knows from Gaza are running out of money, especially after paying the transit fees. He is currently applying for scholarships to study at a university in Egypt or other Arab countries. But in the meantime, international organizations have not provided any support, leaving him dependent on monthly aid from two local charities in Egypt. \u201cWe are from a region devastated by war, and the people there have lost everything,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cInternational organizations need to play a part and provide assistance.\u201d Jeff Crisp, a visiting research fellow at the University of Oxford\u2019s Refugee Studies Centre, echoed this sentiment. \u201cIt should be the responsibility of the UN as a whole (UNHCR, WFP, UNICEF, IOM, etc.) to step in and support the Palestinians,\u201d he wrote via email. One major problem is that those who have fled Gaza are not considered refugees. This means that the two U.N. refugee agencies\u2014the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which protects non-Palestinian refugees, and UNRWA, which is solely responsible for Palestinian refugees\u2014can\u2019t support them. UNRWA spokesperson Tamara Alrifai wrote in an email to Foreign Policy, \u201cUNRWA does not have programs in Egypt, in the way it runs schools, health centers and social support in the areas where it has a mandate to operate.\u201d She added that UNRWA, unlike UNHCR, \u201cdoes not have a mandate to resettle refugees into new countries.\u201d The Egyptian government has refused to recognize Palestinians as refugees since 1978, instead referring to them as \u201cour guests\u201d or \u201cour siblings.\u201d It has long opposed both the establishment of a UNRWA operational office in Cairo and the displacement of Gaza\u2019s population into its territory, citing potential threats to regional security and fears that Israel would not allow displaced Palestinians to return to the coastal enclave. But many experts, including the U.N.\u2019s special rapporteur on torture, argue that Egypt has legal obligations to accept refugees. Crisp stated in his email, \u201cEgypt is a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention and should do what it can to support any that arrive from Gaza.\u201d He added that Palestinians who fled war should be treated as displaced people. For now, without residency papers, most of the Palestinians who recently arrived from Gaza are at risk of deportation. The Palestinian Embassy in Cairo is urging Egyptian authorities to provide papers as soon as possible so that children who have left Gaza can attend school in the fall, according to the embassy official. The Egyptian government has, however, supported some Palestinians who have been injured in the war. Health Minister Khaled Abdel Ghaffar said in May that around 5,500 injured people had been evacuated from Gaza for medical care in 160 hospitals across Egypt since the start of the conflict. These individuals are treated at the Egyptian government\u2019s expense. The process, however, is not easy. \u201cIt was a torture journey,\u201d said Um Qusai, who was able to leave Gaza so that her six-year-old daughter, Noor, could get eye surgery. One of Noor\u2019s eyes had fallen out after debris from an Israeli bomb fell onto her bedroom in October. After six months in the European Hospital in Gaza, Um Qusai finally secured a medical transfer for Noor, making their entry to Egypt free. But because they did not have passports, she had to wait with Noor and her two other children for 12 hours at the Rafah border crossing, while Noor was in agonizing pain, before border authorities let them in. Once they arrive in Egypt, many Palestinians who received free medical transfers are not allowed to leave the hospital. A number of those patients, along with family members accompanying them, told Foreign Policy that they felt trapped inside hospitals and would only be permitted to leave if they returned to Gaza. Egyptian volunteers have arranged trips to bring Palestinian patients food, medication, and clothing. However, some volunteers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they had to undergo lengthy bureaucratic procedures to obtain authorization from Egyptian officials to visit the patients due to strict hospital security measures. For now, many Palestinians in Egypt must rely on the support of local charities and grassroots initiatives to get by. In November, Sherif Mohyeldeen, an Egyptian researcher and nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, launched For the People, a grassroots group with about 60 members, to support injured Palestinians and their families in Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt. So far, he said, the initiative has collected donations to support more than 1,200 Palestinians with food and cash assistance for rent. \u201cPeople have come here with only their clothes,\u201d Mohyeldeen said. \u201cThere is a huge amount of psychological and physical suffering.\u201d The Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research has reported that more than 60 percent of people in Gaza have lost family members since Israel\u2019s war\u2014which has killed more than 40,000 people in the territory, according to the Gaza Health Ministry\u2014began in October. Sherif added that his group has yet to find solutions for families who need prosthetic limbs or chemotherapy, both of which are extremely expensive, as well as Palestinian students whose annual university tuition in Egypt exceeds $4,000. Abdullah Abu al-Aoun, a 26-year-old man from a wealthy family in Gaza, is also trying to help others who have fled. His family owned many buildings and two restaurants in Gaza\u2019s Remal district, all of which were bombed by the Israeli army. After fleeing Gaza with 22 members of his family in February, he opened a Shawarma restaurant in Cairo. His mother\u2019s Egyptian passport and the family\u2019s savings of more than $100,000 helped him establish the business. Aoun has hired three young men from Gaza in his new restaurant and has been helping other Palestinian families in Cairo with cash assistance. \u201cAlthough there is still war in Gaza, some aid is getting in,\u201d he said on May 25 while sitting in the restaurant, where four men from Gaza were dining. \u201cHere, the families who left for Egypt are not getting any support.\u201d But individuals and small charities can only make so much of a difference compared with international organizations\u2014and many Palestinians, including Aoun\u2019s family, know that they may have to stay in Egypt for years to come due to the scale of destruction in Gaza. According to the Palestinian Embassy official, many more Palestinians are expected to arrive in the coming months. With no humanitarian relief on the horizon and Cairo so far refusing to provide residency permits, they sink deeper into uncertainty with each passing day. \u201cWhat really scares me is the unknown future,\u201d Naghan said. \u201cWhen will the crossing open again? If we return, will we live in a tent or on the rubble of our house?\u201d",

In the spring, student demonstrators across the country sought a range of goals, including the expression of solidarity with the Palestinians, an end to U.S. military aid to Israel, a permanent cease-fire in Gaza, and university divestment from businesses linked to Israel. At many universities, administrators called on campus police or local law enforcement to clear protest encampments, often resulting in student arrests. Some universities suspended or expelled student protesters or barred them from graduating. The Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) Project at William &amp; Mary\u2019s Global Research Institute, with support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, recently surveyed international relations scholars at U.S. colleges and universities about their views on the conflict in the Middle East and related student protests. The results reported below are based on responses from 733 IR experts\u2014nearly all of whom are political scientists\u2014surveyed between June 25 and July 14. (Complete results can be found here.) The foreign-policy experts we surveyed overwhelmingly disapprove of ongoing Israeli military action in Gaza and say the issue is a very important one to them in the U.S. presidential election in November. They also believe that the student protests will hurt the Democratic Party in that election. But IR scholars say the protests will not be particularly effective at achieving one of their major goals: university divestment from businesses that profit from Israeli military action. At the same time, these faculty members are divided over whether universities should divest and whether students should have a say in where their schools\u2019 endowments are invested. However, they are clear that universities should not boycott collaborations with Israeli universities and scholars in response to Israeli action in Gaza. Experts Oppose Israeli Action in Gaza Both IR experts and the U.S. public oppose ongoing Israeli military action in Gaza, but the experts do so at a much higher rate. The scholars whom we surveyed overwhelmingly disapprove of the Israeli response to the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack: Nearly 77 percent disapprove, compared with less than 17 percent who approve of the military action in Gaza. The U.S. public is somewhat more divided but still opposed: According to a March Gallup poll, 55 percent disapprove of Israeli military action in Gaza, while 36 percent approve. There are unsurprisingly strong partisan differences in people\u2019s responses\u2014which are stronger among academics than among the U.S. public. Eighty-one percent of self-reported Republican experts approve of Israel\u2019s military response, compared with 64 percent of Republicans among the public. Similarly, 85 percent of self-reported Democratic experts disapprove of Israel\u2019s policy, compared with 75 percent of Democrats among the public. On Gaza and the Presidential Election Both the strength of expert opposition to Israeli military action in Gaza and the partisan differences among IR scholars likely help explain the importance that these experts place on the issue. When we asked how important they considered a list of foreign-policy issues in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, 65 percent of respondents said the conflict in Gaza was \u201cvery important\u201d or \u201cextremely important.\u201d By this metric, foreign-policy experts considered the conflict to be more important as an election issue than numerous other issues, including conflict over Taiwan or the South China Sea, global public health, immigration, international terrorism, U.S. economic and military aid, and trade. Of the issues we asked about, experts only ranked the conflict in Ukraine and climate change as more important than the conflict in Gaza. Despite the partisan nature of the issue, Republican, Democratic, and independent experts agreed on its importance to them in the presidential election. Remarkably similar percentages of each group of respondents\u201468 percent of Republicans, 66 percent of Democrats, and 63 percent of independents\u2014identified the conflict in Gaza as very or extremely important in the upcoming election. (It is worth noting that our sample of experts overwhelmingly identify as Democrats: 66 percent are self-reported Democrats, 25 percent are self-reported independents, and just under 4 percent identify as Republicans.) So, how might the Israeli military action in Gaza\u2014and the pro-Palestinian campus protests\u2014influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election? The foreign-policy experts agree that the issue does not bode well for Democrats in November. Our survey launched when U.S. President Joe Biden was still running for reelection, so the question asked about the electoral effects for Biden, not Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic nominee. It is difficult to estimate how Harris\u2019s name at the top of the ticket might shape experts\u2019 predictions about the effects of this issue on the election. Harris has not broken with Biden\u2019s strongly pro-Israel policies, but she has publicly expressed greater concern for the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. At the time, 51 percent of the IR scholars we surveyed thought that the student protests would make U.S. voters less likely to vote for Biden, whereas only 2 percent thought that protests would spell trouble for the Republican nominee, former U.S. President Donald Trump. And while nearly one-third (31 percent) of respondents thought that the protests would help Trump\u2019s electoral chances, a scant 1 percent thought they would help Biden. There is substantial agreement across party lines that the protests over the conflict in Gaza would make voters less likely to support Biden. Among IR experts, 56 percent of Republicans, 51 percent of Democrats, and 52 percent of independents thought that the university protests would hurt Biden. Interestingly, there was less agreement about the extent to which the protests made voters more likely to vote for Trump: 52 percent of Republicans but only 30 percent of Democrats and 31 percent of independents said the protests would make U.S. voters more likely to pull the lever for the Republican nominee. On University Divestment and Academic Boycotts It\u2019s unclear whether the student protesters intend to influence the result of the U.S. presidential election. But they do want to pressure their universities into divesting their endowment funds from companies that do business in or with Israel. Have they been successful in this regard? The IR faculty don\u2019t think so: 62 percent of respondents thought that the demonstrations would have no effect on whether universities elect to sell their investments in companies with ties to Israel, while only 27 percent thought that they would make universities more likely to divest. The IR experts are divided over whether the colleges and universities where they teach should divest and whether students should have a say in that decision. Our survey respondents were more likely to have an opinion on universities selling their investments in companies doing business with Israel than were members of the U.S. public, presumably because the respondents study IR and most work at colleges and universities. Of the surveyed IR scholars, 40 percent supported divestment, compared with 23 percent of the public, as measured in a May Economist/YouGov survey. Similarly, 45 percent of scholars opposed divestment, compared with 35 percent of the public. Large segments of the public were \u201cnot sure\u201d what they thought about divestment, possibly because of lower levels of knowledge about the conflict and about the university system. Interesting patterns emerge among different categories of respondents. For example, women faculty were far more likely (54 percent) than men (35 percent) to support divestment. Similarly, 43 percent of Democrats but only 15 percent of Republicans favored universities selling their investments in companies tied to Israel. The partisan gap is narrower among the public: According to the Economist/YouGov poll, 27 percent of Democrats and 21 percent of Republicans favored divestment. Women, meanwhile, were less likely than men to advocate that universities sell investments in companies that might profit from the war in Gaza. The IR experts were evenly split on whether students should have a say in where their colleges\u2019 financial endowments are invested. When asked this question, 41 percent of the surveyed scholars said yes, while 41 percent said no. Again, women scholars were more likely than men and Democrats more likely than Republicans to want students to have a voice in investing their schools\u2019 endowments. IR faculty may disagree about whether schools should divest and whether students should be involved in such decisions, but their commitment to academic freedom runs deep. When asked whether their universities should boycott collaborations with Israeli universities and scholars\u2014including study abroad programs, co-authorships, visiting scholars, and speakers\u2014the experts resoundingly said no. Of those surveyed, 86 percent opposed cutting these academic ties, while only 7 percent expressed support. This result is particularly striking since the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) recently reversed its long-standing policy of opposing academic boycotts. Although we do not know whether IR faculty members are representative of the broader AAUP membership, their preferences do not align with the policy change. Sizable majorities of both the IR experts and the U.S. public disapprove of the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack. Despite this widespread opposition, IR professors are more dubious about the goals of the pro-Palestinian protests that dominated college campuses in the spring and have returned this fall. Scholars were more likely to oppose than to support university divestment from companies doing business with Israel and were evenly split on whether students should even have a say. They came down strongly in favor of continued collaboration with Israeli academics. Additionally, most of the surveyed scholars agreed that the protests are unlikely to achieve real change in university policy; respondents felt that the protests may even make U.S. voters more likely to support Trump in the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The experts\u2019 cynicism about the campus protests underscores the significant but complicated role that the demonstrations and faculty perspectives will play in shaping both campus policy and broader political outcomes as the election draws near.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Talking about a \u201crules-based order\u201d won\u2019t overcome Washington\u2019s hypocrisy problem.",
                    "post_content": "U.S. President Joe Biden frequently speaks of the global contest between autocracy and democracy, but Vice President Kamala Harris prefers discussing the need to promote a \u201crules-based order.\u201d If the topic of foreign policy arises at the Sept. 10 presidential debate, viewers are likely to hear about it. People close to Harris attribute this inclination to her prosecutorial past\u2014she appreciates the importance of rules\u2014and to the inconvenient fact that so many U.S. allies are autocrats. But the shift in terminology won\u2019t allow her to dodge the hypocrisy at the heart of U.S. foreign policy. Nothing crystallizes that dilemma more than Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza\u2014and Washington\u2019s ongoing and largely unconditional military support to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A growing number of Western governments have chosen a different path. Italy, Spain, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, and most recently the new British government have limited at least some arms sales to Israel because of its bombing and starving of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Biden is right to worry about the autocratic challenge to democracy. The Chinese government of Xi Jinping is trying to dumb down human rights law to require only economic growth; \u201csocial stability\u201d (often achieved through repression); and a vague, manipulable \u201chappy life.\u201d Designed to curb condemnation of Beijing\u2019s authoritarian rule, this redefinition\u2014if widely endorsed\u2014would eviscerate the human rights that are essential to democracy. Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach is different. On the one hand, the Kremlin promotes so-called \u201ctraditional values,\u201d a backward-looking social conservatism that allows no place for the rights of LGBTQ people and would consign many women to the home. On the other hand, Russian propagandists try to undermine the fact-based discourse needed to enforce rights standards. As Russian forces attack civilians in Ukraine, the Kremlin denies and spins. Russians who present the truth are imprisoned. Yet Biden has met these challenges to democracy by building alliances that include autocrats. Once treated as a pariah after the Saudi Arabian government\u2019s murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2019, the Saudi crown prince is now courted to pump more oil and normalize relations with Israel. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has imposed the worst repression in Egypt\u2019s modern history, but he is a key U.S. partner in addressing the humanitarian disaster in Gaza. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has crushed dissent and fomented violence and discrimination against Muslims, but he is a central player in Biden\u2019s alliance against China. Many governments, seeing this hypocrisy, choose to stay on the sidelines. If the United States\u2019 opposition to autocracy is so unprincipled, then why shouldn\u2019t other governments also be selective, allowing themselves to be bought off by Chinese loans or Russian arms? But touting the \u201crules-based order\u201d as an alternative framework also presents dilemmas for U.S. policy. Harris seems to emphasize respect for sovereignty\u2014which is defined by rules such as \u201cdon\u2019t invade your neighbor\u201d\u2014as well as the standards needed for global trade and investment, but that is hardly the limit of international law. The rules-based order also includes international human rights and humanitarian law. And as any prosecutor knows, a law-abiding person cannot pick and choose the laws to be respected. Of course, autocrats flout international human rights law. They dedicate themselves to preventing citizens from asserting their rights to challenge their reigns. But some democracies also violate international humanitarian law on the conduct of war\u2014and Israel has been doing just that for nearly one year. Although Hamas\u2019s atrocities on Oct. 7, 2023, and its ongoing detention of hostages are clear war crimes, a basic premise of international humanitarian law is that war crimes committed by one side never justify war crimes by the other. As Harris herself has noted, Israel\u2019s right to defend itself does not exempt it from the rules for how war must be fought\u2014such as the Geneva Conventions and their later added protocols. The Israeli military\u2019s conduct of the war in Gaza has been replete with alleged war crimes, from reports of Israel indiscriminately bombing Palestinian civilians to accusations of starving them. The International Criminal Court prosecutor has charged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for the starvation strategy, with more charges likely to follow, and the International Court of Justice ordered Israel in January to end its partial obstruction of food and other necessities. U.S. domestic law that supports those international standards is also part of the \u201crules.\u201d These days, most discussions of legal limits on U.S. military aid and arms sales apply the Leahy Law, which prohibits U.S. assistance to any unit of a \u201cforeign security force\u201d that is committing gross violations of human rights. But that is a modest requirement compared to the far broader Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which remains valid and provides that \u201cno security assistance may be provided to any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u201d The Leahy Law was adopted in 1997 to allow a more incremental approach to military aid, but it turned out that it is often difficult to prove which particular unit is responsible for a military\u2019s abuses, and addressing a single unit falls far short of ending a military\u2019s broader abuses. The State Department briefly considered but decided against halting aid to four Israeli units that had allegedly been abusive against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, ostensibly because Israel had taken remedial measures, but Israel\u2019s overall conduct in Gaza clearly fails the broader test. It is also a violation of international criminal law to arm a systematically abusive force. After receiving a conviction in 2012 by an internationally backed tribunal, former Liberian President Charles Taylor is serving a 50-year sentence in a British prison for aiding and abetting war crimes carried out by a rebel force in neighboring Sierra Leone. No one expects the International Criminal Court to charge Biden for aiding and abetting Israeli war crimes, but the fact that it could underscores the seriousness of today\u2019s unconditional arms flow to Israel. Harris could signal a different approach from Biden\u2019s by stating her determination to avoid U.S. complicity in Israeli war crimes. The United Kingdom\u2019s new prime minister, Keir Starmer\u2014himself a former prosecutor\u2014announced this month that Britain would suspend the sale of certain arms that Israel could use in Gaza after a Foreign Office review found a \u201cclear risk\u201d that British arms may be used in violation of humanitarian law, but the Biden administration has largely ignored that law. Washington did suspend the shipment of the huge, 2,000-pound bombs that Israel was using to decimate neighborhoods in Gaza but has otherwise allowed arms and billions in military aid to flow unimpeded. The White House occasionally mouths appropriate warnings\u2014urging Netanyahu to stop bombing and starving Palestinian civilians and to agree to a cease-fire\u2014but because the U.S. government imposes no consequences for ignoring these warnings, Netanyahu pays little heed. The world sees this double standard. Indeed, given the massive suffering and loss of life in Gaza, the outrage at Israel\u2019s exemption from the so-called rules-based order is probably greater than the discontent over the various autocratic exceptions to Biden\u2019s promotion of democracy. While Harris is vice president, there are practical limits to her ability to break publicly with Biden\u2019s policies, but that shouldn\u2019t stop her from discussing how, as president, her approach would differ. There is also undoubtedly an element of electoral calculation in her caution, even though there is growing disquiet at Washington\u2019s ongoing support for Israeli war crimes among key Democratic constituencies, including swing state Michigan\u2019s large Arab American population. Beginning with tonight\u2019s debate against the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, Harris should explain where she stands. Just as a prosecutor shouldn\u2019t close her eyes to serious crimes, a president shouldn\u2019t ignore major breaches of the \u201crules-based order.\u201d",

                    "post_excerpt": "A technically adroit strike could be a curtain-raiser for an expanded conflict. ",
                    "post_content": "In a coordinated attack across Lebanon and parts of Syria, hundreds of pagers used by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah simultaneously exploded on Tuesday, killing more than a dozen people and injuring thousands of others. No group has claimed responsibility, but the overwhelmingly likely culprit is Israel. Israel\u2019s multifront war has broadened, including not only Hamas in Gaza but also Iran and its Axis of Resistance, a collection of proxy groups that includes Hezbollah. Many are wondering why now. Is there a broader significance to the timing of the attack? Israel has said preventing Hezbollah attacks is among its war goals, despite warnings from the United States against a wider operation that could lead to all-out regional war. The pager attack could very well be the opening salvo to a prolonged Israeli military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon\u2014or it could just be the latest clandestine operation in the long-running shadow war between Israel and Iran\u2019s proxies. It is also possible that the Israelis triggered the operation because there was a time limit on how long it could continue undiscovered. For Mossad, Israel\u2019s intelligence service, the attack may go a long way toward polishing a reputation badly tarnished by failures around Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The pager operation itself seems out of a spy novel. There are myriad hypotheses circulating about how Mossad could have pulled off an attack this large and this dramatic. We don\u2019t yet know whether bombs were implanted at the manufacturing stage or whether the supply chain was compromised at another phase in the process. Hezbollah relied on antiquated means of communications such as pagers, possibly believing they were beyond the reach of Israel\u2019s cyberwarriors. Following the Oct. 7 attack, Hezbollah personnel largely sought to eschew the use of cellphones, with the group\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, urging fighters to instead use alternative methods of communication. Some have speculated that malware injected into the devices could have caused the batteries to overheat and then, ultimately, the devices to explode. However, the attack was organized; it was done so with meticulous planning and attention to detail. Apart from the immediate impact of the attack, the capabilities demonstrated will render Hezbollah increasingly paranoid and uncertain of exactly what Mossad might pull off next. Hezbollah will likely follow this attack with a comprehensive overhaul of its internal security apparatus, reviewing where the gaps in its operational security exist and attempting to shore up the tradecraft of its members. There could even be an internal purge for moles, a hunt that could lead to bloodletting within Hezbollah\u2014an added bonus for Israel\u2019s spooks. One of the drivers behind the pager attack, as with the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July, is that Mossad is determined to refurbish its brand. Before the Oct. 7 attack, Israeli intelligence enjoyed a reputation as omnipotent, its legendary exploits retold in blockbuster spy movies such as Steven Spielberg\u2019s Munich and the hit Netflix series Fauda. Israel\u2019s targeted assassination campaign has so far killed Hamas deputy political leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut in January and Hezbollah senior commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut in late July, in addition to Haniyeh shortly after. In addition to brand management for Mossad, Israel\u2019s covert operations have a more practical effect. Hezbollah command and control has likely been wrecked, causing the group substantial communications issues in the near term. Moreover, Tuesday\u2019s attack injured hundreds of Hezbollah fighters, some of whom will undoubtedly be maimed, missing fingers, hands, or suffering other injuries that will put them on the sidelines, at least temporarily. The Houthis in Yemen, militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and other Iranian proxies will now begin taking greater precautions. This could change the way these groups communicate with one another, which, in turn, could directly affect coordination and hamper their ability to launch attacks of their own. The impact will be felt far beyond Lebanon, with other illicit groups worldwide\u2014terrorists, criminals, and hackers\u2014questioning the safety of their personal communication devices. Nasrallah claims that Hezbollah does not want total war with Israel and has implied that his group remains engaged militarily on behalf of its Palestinian brethren in Gaza. Yet, even when multiple stakeholders claim that they want to avert war, it can still happen, as it did with Hezbollah and Israel in July 2006, a war that brought massive devastation to Lebanon and ended in somewhat of a stalemate. One could argue that it was a strategic defeat for Israel, since Hezbollah has only grown exponentially more powerful since the end of that war. Eighteen years after that 34-day conflict, Hezbollah is an entirely different organization, with more advanced weaponry, more men under arms, and greater political legitimacy not just in Lebanon but throughout parts of the Islamic world. As Seth G. Jones and Daniel Byman correctly pointed out recently, war with Hezbollah would be Israel\u2019s biggest challenge in decades. Nevertheless, that\u2019s exactly where things could be headed. Hezbollah will feel compelled to respond to the pager attack, humiliated by the success of the operation and thirsty for revenge. Israel\u2019s new war aim of moving its displaced population back to the north near the border with Lebanon, nearly 60,000 people in total, will require pushing Hezbollah\u2019s forces away from the border and back toward a manageable buffer zone. Even if Hezbollah claims to want to avoid war, any number of miscommunications could propel both sides toward conflict as the tit-for-tat exchanges continue and each side seeks to position its forces to gain a first-mover advantage. As the Israelis know well, Hezbollah is not Hamas. Hezbollah is more akin to a conventional military, and its arsenal contains upwards of 150,000 rockets and precision-guided munitions. Hezbollah is, without question, among the most complete, well-trained, and resourced nonstate actors in global politics. Its fighters are battle-hardened from combat deployments to Syria, where they worked alongside Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards and experimented with new, high-tech weaponry. The pager attack is likely to have serious implications for Lebanon, the conflict between Israel and Iran\u2019s proxies, and for the Middle East as a whole. Roughly three weeks out from the grim anniversary of Oct. 7, the region remains on a knife\u2019s edge. Hard-line elements on all sides may see it in their interest to escalate, while ongoing diplomatic efforts prove too little, too late.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The militant group must decide between walking back its threat to northern Israel or risking the loss of its advanced missile capabilities.",
                    "post_content": "In less than a week, Israel has managed to significantly degrade Hezbollah\u2019s military capabilities, communications systems, and chain of command. First, exploding pagers and walkie-talkies undermined the group\u2019s ability to communicate. Then came the assassination of operations commander Ibrahim Aqil on Friday\u2014along with 14 top Radwan Force commanders\u2014which was a major setback for the Lebanese militant group\u2019s top leadership and command unit, the Jihad Council. From the founding members of Hezbollah\u2019s military structure, only Ali Karaki survives today. This escalation comes after Israeli leaders decided to confront the continuous threat to the country\u2019s north posed by Hezbollah. Last Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s security cabinet decided to set a new war goal: the safe return of Israeli residents to the country\u2019s north. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is not conceding, however. In a speech given on Sept. 19, Nasrallah doubled down on attacking Israel\u2019s north. Despite his acknowledgement of Israel\u2019s technological advances, the leader of Hezbollah refused to back down and threated that \u201cno military escalation, no killings, no assassinations, and no all-out war can return residents to the border.\u201d Immediately after his speech, Israel struck approximately 30 Hezbollah rocket launchers and infrastructure sites, which contained approximately 150 launcher barrels, according to a spokesperson from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF also hit Hezbollah\u2019s weapons storage facilities in multiple areas in southern Lebanon, followed by more intense strikes over the weekend, with Israel claiming on Saturday that it had eliminated 400 rocket launchers across southern Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley. The scale of these strikes indicates Israel\u2019s appetite for escalation and willingness to widen the circle of targets. Despite the calls to go all in, an Israeli decision to launch a full-scale war or land incursion has not been made yet. Such a decision would bring the country and its civilian infrastructure much damage, especially if Hezbollah unleashes its most advanced missiles. It seems that Israel is determined to push Hezbollah to change its strategy and revisit its involvement in the conflict, which the group initiated on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after the Hamas attacks on Israel. Hezbollah now faces a choice: to preserve what is left of its military assets and leadership, or to maintain its threat over the north of Israel. The losses that Hezbollah suffered last week were immense, but the group lost the deterrence battle months ago. Since last October\u2014when Hezbollah decided to attack Israel in support of Hamas\u2014Israel has been successful at degrading the group\u2019s military capabilities with precise targeted attacks, and it has done so largely without causing many civilian casualties. In the past year, Israel has killed more than 500 people\u2014most of them Hezbollah militants\u2014 including top and elite commanders, such as Wissam al-Tawil, Taleb Abdullah, Fuad Shukr, and others. In addition, Hezbollah\u2019s military infrastructure south of the Litani River has been demolished, along with a large number of its weapons depots and military infrastructure across Lebanon. The group\u2019s responses focused mostly on the north of Israel, targeting military bases and infrastructure while mostly avoiding civilian casualties, major cities, and civilian infrastructure. At the beginning of the war, the goal of Hezbollah and Iran\u2014the group\u2019s main backer\u2014was to reap the benefits from any political or diplomatic solution that would end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. But along the way, they managed to achieve an unprecedented feat\u2014to move the buffer zone from the south of Lebanon to the north of Israel. Around 60,000 Israelis remain internally displaced, and Hezbollah has communicated this to its constituency as the biggest ever achievement against Israel. It will be very difficult to walk back from this. If Israel widens the circle of targets to hit advanced military assets, such as the facilities that store and produce precision-guided missiles, Hezbollah might revisit its threat to the north. Today, the group is walking a very thin line between its assets and its threats, and the question is how many more losses it can endure. Israel sees this as an opportunity to push further\u2014and raise the price for Hezbollah until it becomes unbearable. Although a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah is a real possibility, both parties still prefer a diplomatic solution. Israel is trying to keep its attacks targeted, and Hezbollah is trying hard not to provoke Israel or be forced to use and waste its most valuable military assets\u2014namely, precision missiles\u2014which Iran regards as an insurance policy. Indeed, Israel could be escalating today to avoid war; that is, to push Hezbollah to accept the only diplomatic solution on the table\u2014the one presented by Amos Hochstein (the U.S. envoy for international energy affairs) to delink Lebanon from Gaza and implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah. This means that Hezbollah will have to accept a separate cease-fire agreement, withdraw its military presence to north of the Litani River, roughly 18 miles away from the border, and allow displaced Israelis to return safely to the north. Until last week, Israel and Hezbollah had been walking a very thin line between a full-scale war and a calculated pattern of attacks and responses. Hezbollah lost military infrastructure, commanders, and weapons, but most importantly, it lost security and trust among its ranks. After every assassination or strike, and specifically with the mass explosions of pagers and radios, Hezbollah now fears more in-depth infiltration in its ranks by the Israeli intelligence agencies. And its militants lost trust in their own, fearing that anyone could be an Israeli spy. The group also lost trust in technology and has no reliable communications system that it could rely on for any military response or war. The only way left is verbal communications, which its leaders resorted to when the in-person meeting between Akil and the Radwan Forces was scheduled\u2014and then hit by an Israeli strike. The level of infiltration is deeper than they know. Additionally, Hezbollah has lost the trust of its own community. If it cannot protect itself, many are asking, then how can it protect its constituency and supporters? It will be very difficult to assure its community of safety and security while walking\u2014and exploding\u2014among them. Worse still, the group is no longer Iran\u2019s success story in the region. The fact that Israel could kill Shukr and Akil in the middle of their stronghold in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh is a big breach. However, what is a lot more troubling for Hezbollah\u2019s leadership is its loss of the element of surprise, which has always been part of its military strategy. Israel knew exactly when and how Hezbollah was planning to retaliate for Shukr in August, as the IDF launched a preemptive strike against the group\u2019s infrastructure, including the launchers it had prepared for the operation. All these losses, in addition to the group\u2019s incapacity thus far to conduct an effective military response against Israel, is both humiliating and embarrassing for Hezbollah. But on the military level, it is worse: Hezbollah is more deterred than ever. The group could eventually recover from these losses, rebuild its communication network, counter Israeli intelligence, and regain trust among its community. But this is all going to take a long time, a luxury that Hezbollah might not be able to afford. Today, any response to Israel\u2019s escalation requires the militant group to resolve the following concerns: First, without a proper communications system, Hezbollah cannot coordinate on targeting, responses, or logistics. It also cannot easily use verbal or written communications\u2014similar to the system that Hamas is currently using inside Gaza\u2019s tunnels. Lebanon is much bigger, and without an efficient and fast communication system, Hezbollah\u2019s military capability to conduct war is largely diminished. Second, many top Hezbollah officials have been killed or injured. The pagers that exploded hit many of the group\u2019s senior and mid-level operatives. The shipment contained 5,000 pagers, and Hezbollah\u2019s fighting force alone has been independently estimated to comprise at least 20,000 militants. Pagers were provided to officials and fighters with special skills and missions; that is, those who need to be protected. Families of Hezbollah members of Lebanon\u2019s parliament and high-ranking commanders, in addition to high-level security personnel, were among the casualties\u2014not to mention Iran\u2019s ambassador to Lebanon, who was reportedly in close proximity to an exploding device. Finally, Hezbollah still hasn\u2019t figured out how deeply infiltrated by Israeli intelligence it is. Sources close to its inner circle have told Foreign Policy that the group\u2019s leaders are looking into every single piece of electronic gear they own, and that they are worried that their cars, motorcycles, and even their advanced missile factories are booby-trapped and could go off any minute. The group will have to conduct an in-depth investigation to make sure that other items have not been infiltrated or compromised by the Israelis, which will take weeks. And if Hezbollah fears that its missiles facilities are booby-trapped or monitored, it will be logistically very difficult to safely move these weapons in order to launch them. The Israeli government seems to think that Hezbollah\u2019s setbacks are a good opportunity for the IDF to launch a war to further erode the group\u2019s capabilities. But a war similar to that of 2006 might cause Israel real damage without leading to the elimination of the Hezbollah threat. Moreover, it could lead to more international isolation and more civilian casualties on both sides, as well as risk a regional war from multiple fronts. What the IDF and its external intelligence agency, Mossad, have achieved in the past week has been very effective. There is no need for a full-scale war that would cause civilian losses, bring back \u201caxis of resistance\u201d rhetoric, and unite regional and international public opinion against Israel. Until a long-term solution is reached, the best-case scenario is for Hezbollah to accept a separate cease-fire, disconnected from the war in Gaza. Diplomatic messaging from the United States and its allies needs to focus on this objective and pressure Hezbollah to delink the two fronts. For Iran and Hezbollah, nothing is more important than their military assets\u2014especially precision missiles. U.S. diplomatic efforts need to take advantage of Hezbollah\u2019s vulnerability. In addition to forcing the group to accept a separate cease-fire, negotiations should be focused on preventing a full-scale war, allowing residents from both sides to return home, and undermining Hezbollah\u2019s and Iran\u2019s narratives of victory and resistance. U.N. Resolution 1701 is not sustainable because it does not include punitive measures, and Hezbollah will eventually violate it. Therefore, a long-term policy will have to be designed after a cease-fire is achieved in order to contain Hezbollah in Lebanon\u2014a policy that will address interrupting its weapons supply routes from Tehran via Iraq and Syria as well as help the Lebanese state regain its sovereignty when it comes to decisions of war and peace.",

                    "post_content": "U.S. diplomacy is at its best when American diplomats are informed by the diverse perspectives of leaders, foreign service officers, and private sector citizens. Serious diplomacy requires more than talking with friends and like-minded groups. It must also include efforts to engage freely and frankly with adversaries and those who might wish the United States ill. In places such as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, long before Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the United States fell far short of that ideal. It has rarely engaged with openness and sincerity. Diplomats long ago promised that Washington could be fair and even-handed with the Palestinians. The Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995 envisioned Palestinian autonomy, Israeli military withdrawal, a five-year process of disengagement, and final status talks leading to peace. It was believed that the U.S. government would open a consulate in Palestine and be amenable to talking without restrictions or preconditions to advance peace. However, these goals were never fully actualized. Unfortunately, the U.S. government has increased restrictions on diplomats and humanitarian workers in the region, undermining their ability to do their jobs effectively. Many of those who manage development or humanitarian assistance efforts in the occupied Palestinian territories, particularly the Gaza Strip, have personal experience with the U.S. government\u2019s \u201cno-contact policy.\u201d This policy morphed out of the long-standard Western government line that \u201cwe won\u2019t negotiate ransoms with terrorists\u201d and the history of foreign terrorist organization (FTO) designations since the post-9/11 executive orders of then-President George W. Bush. The Bush administration designated Hamas as an FTO after it won Gazan elections in 2006. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) issued policy directive Mission Order 21 soon after, prohibiting virtually any assistance or support by U.S.-led organizations to groups even minimally connected to the Hamas-run de facto authority in Gaza. The U.S. State Department and USAID lawyers, in a series of agency partner meetings and shared legal opinions, further interpreted that order to bar contact with any governmental authority in Gaza, including any civil governmental ministry or office. In late 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the Taylor Force Act, which was signed into law by then-President Donald Trump. It barred any U.S. government assistance to the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority unless it stopped compensation payments to the family members of Palestinians who carried out lone wolf attacks against Israeli targets and citizens and were subsequently detained or killed by Israeli forces. The act overturned U.S. government assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, curtailed development and humanitarian aid, and ended meaningful efforts to engage with Palestinian authorities. By depriving Palestinians of broad-based agriculture, trade promotion, water infrastructure, and economic development funds, U.S. policies impoverished vulnerable Palestinian communities and marginalized any possible rise of moderate alternatives, promoting the agendas of extremists on both sides. Palestinians endured a rolling annexation of their lands, as Israeli settlers demolished homes and engaged in violent activities against Palestinian communities with a total absence of accountability. These U.S. policies cost dearly in terms of blood and lives, both Israeli and Palestinian, and enabled lawlessness by Israeli forces and civilians in the occupied Palestinian territories. It fed further hopelessness for Gazans caught between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in what became the world\u2019s largest outdoor prison: The Gaza International Airport was closed in 2001 after a little more than two years of operation, Gazan land access was cut off almost completely, the number of Gazans with work permits allowing employment in Israel dropped more than 90 percent to below 10,000 people, and access to the sea for fishing was limited to areas within six nautical miles of the coast. Few, if any, humanitarian medical cases were allowed parole and care in Israeli hospitals. Commercial trade with the outside world was restricted. Studies have challenged the efficacy and effectiveness of the non-negotiation approach, particularly when broadened from its aim of avoiding terrorist ransoms to include the withholding of all funds to any FTO designees. As a U.S. senior foreign service officer, these counterproductive policies often constrained my team in Gaza. We engaged in expensive and time-consuming vetting operations on organizations and staff to avoid the slightest possibility of linkage with the de facto authorities. We were greatly limited in potential partners among small-scale civil society and community-based organizations. Health care activities, even those addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, could not refer to Ministry of Health clinics and hospitals. We could not support government-run vaccination or case-tracking efforts. Psychosocial counseling and treatment could not be linked with any government mental health providers. Nongovernmental organizations implementing programs in the occupied Palestinian territories have further been harassed and victimized through the unintended use of U.S. laws such as the False Claims Act. Under this Civil War-era law, modified by Congress in 1943, 1986 and 2010, private entities and citizens can file\u00a0qui tam\u00a0actions alleging that\u00a0target groups \u201cdefrauded\u201d\u00a0the federal government, effectively turning the plaintiffs into bounty hunters. This has been applied aggressively as \u201clawfare\u201d against charitable grantees and nonprofits managing U.S. development and humanitarian assistance in the occupied Palestinian territories. If a\u00a0suit\u00a0succeeds, then the private instigator may receive up to 30 percent of the government\u2019s award. As a result of the no-contact policy, FTO designations, and U.S. laws, several international NGOs were sued in U.S. courts by anti-Palestinian right-wing activists and accused of giving material aid to Hamas, including organizations such as Diakonia Sweden, Oxfam Great Britain, the Carter Center, and Norwegian People\u2019s Aid. For example, U.S.-based pro-Israel activists from the Zionist Advocacy Center and NGO Monitor found photos showing low-level Gaza Health Ministry staff at a table for a Norwegian People\u2019s Aid-managed democracy and health conference. Water bottles visible in the photo were then described as illegal \u201cmaterial aid.\u201d The 2015 suit led to a 2018 pre-trial settlement with no admission of guilt. The Zionist Advocacy Center threatened other nuisance lawsuits against international NGOs and nonprofit charities seeking to provide humanitarian assistance worldwide, including in Gaza and the West Bank. While many of these suits were ultimately dismissed in federal court, in multiple cases, charitable organizations shelled out millions of dollars in legal fees to fight nuisance claims. In other cases, they reportedly paid millions to settle cases to avoid legal risks. These restrictions are exquisitely one-sided: There are virtually no penalties or constraints on U.S. assistance to Israel, even as Israeli government policies have promoted illegal settlements, and Israeli security forces have allowed settlers to act with impunity in killing unarmed Palestinians and attacking Palestinian villages and orchards. Since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks against Israel, the impact of these U.S. restrictions has become more apparent and damaging. There is no proportionality or equivalence in treatment: The U.S. government doesn\u2019t designate pro-Israel groups as FTOs even when some of them demonstrably support or instigate settler violence. In a rare punitive move in December 2023, the U.S. State Department announced some visa restrictions on Israeli settlers engaged in violence on the West Bank, following the controversial entry of Israel in the U.S. visa waiver program. However, little concrete accountability has been observed since, with virtually no consequences for IDF units also allegedly violating Palestinian rights and abetting settler violence. The Biden administration and the State Department are only willing to engage indirectly with Hamas. However, this is ineffective and not a substitute for serious great-power diplomacy. As many global humanitarian organizations have noted, Washington can\u2019t claim that it opposes the indiscriminate bombing of innocents, elderly, and children when the U.S. government allows the IDF to act with total impunity. Moreover, it is indefensible not to block, sanction, and punish the attacks on Palestinian villages and communities across the West Bank and the continued expansion of illegal settlements. All these actions have been met with the mildest of reproaches from the White House and from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but with no consequences or accountability for the IDF or the government of Israel. In addition, processes set up to provide accountability have been disregarded. The so-called Leahy Laws aim to stop military aid and weapons flowing from the United States to units and foreign security forces accused of committing gross human rights abuses, specifically restricting weapons provided under foreign military financing. Even so, the Pentagon has provided Israel for decades with more than $3 billion in weapons annually, a figure that has increased since the start of Israel\u2019s war with Hamas on Oct. 7. Since then, the United States has enacted legislation providing at least $12.5 billion in military aid to Israel, including $3.8 billion from a bill in March 2024 and $8.7 billion from a supplemental appropriations act in April 2024. Yet the State Department has sidestepped calls for action and review by its own employees, even while acknowledging persistent reports of human rights abuses in the West Bank and Gaza. Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic nominee in the upcoming presidential election, has not signaled a substantial shift. In her statements, she always prefaces mild calls to stop the war in Gaza with assertions that she unrestrictedly supports Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. This formulaic fallback has not been meaningfully questioned within the Biden administration or the Harris campaign. Few U.S. officials will acknowledge that Israel crossed the line of legitimate self-defense following the Oct. 7 attack when it began launching unrestricted military operations, primarily harming Palestinian civilians. By January 2024, there were few untouched military targets remaining in northern Gaza near Gaza City and in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. In June, IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari admitted to Israeli Channel 13 that the IDF could not fully destroy Hamas. Yet now, almost a year after Oct. 7, Gazan noncombatants must still attempt to survive with constant evacuations from one so-called safe humanitarian zone to another\u2014surrounded by death, destruction, and terror. Blinken has made at least nine trips to the region, ostensibly in pursuit of peace. Legal prohibitions on weapons that could be used to target civilians, such as the Leahy Laws, are routinely ignored by Blinken\u2019s State Department when it comes to Israel. In mid-September, Aysenur Eygi, a 26-year-old Turkish American activist was shot in the head and killed by an Israeli soldier at a protest against Israeli settlements on Palestinian land in the West Bank. While U.S. President Joe Biden quickly called for full accountability, Blinken accepted an IDF preliminary investigation that was challenged by the Washington Post and other witnesses and has demurred in insisting on a U.S.-led independent investigation. Eygi was the third American killed by the IDF in the West Bank since the war started, yet her death has received far less attention from policymakers than the deaths of U.S. citizens caused by Palestinian militants. This is gross negligence and diplomatic malfeasance. Israel's destruction of Gaza will endanger both Israeli and Palestinian lives for years to come, perpetuating endless, unpredictable cycles of violence. The consequences for U.S. diplomacy are tragic. By not holding both sides accountable, utilizing the available tools to curb or block the fighting with U.S. arms, and talking directly with those holding hostages, Washington's diplomatic efforts have surrendered all moral authority and credibility. The White House and Congress must seriously reevaluate the consequences and impact of U.S. laws and policy measures\u2014such as USAID Mission Order 21, the no-contact policy with FTOs, and the Taylor Force Law\u2014that thoroughly undermine and weaken U.S. diplomacy. They should be repealed and be countered with objective application of Leahy Law sanctions on culpable IDF units, leaders, and those providing them political cover.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Tehran was in a stronger strategic position before its proxies plunged the region into war.",
                    "post_content": "There is no shortage of misery in the Middle East today. As the region marked the one-year anniversary of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 massacre, Israel mourned the murder of around 1,200 Israelis and worried about the fate of the remaining 100 hostages held by Hamas. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed in the subsequent war, hundreds of thousands are currently homeless, and much of Gaza lies in ruins. Lebanon, too, is now devolving into a war zone. Often overlooked amid all this misery is Iran, which is also having a terrible, horrible, very bad year. But unlike most of the other actors here, it has only itself to blame. Consider where Iran was strategically on Oct. 6, 2023. The United States, torn between competing demands for its military forces, was looking to reduce its military presence in the Middle East. That brought Iran closer than ever to achieving one of its long-term goals: ridding the region of U.S. influence. Israel, meanwhile, was tearing itself apart at home over controversial judicial reforms. Iran had suffered a strategic blow a few years prior with the passage of the Abraham Accords, which promoted Israel-Arab ties, but Tehran had arguably countered this in part by forging closer military ties to Moscow. True, Iran remained under significant sanctions, but the Biden administration unfroze some $6 billion in Iranian funds in exchange for freeing American prisoners. Now consider where Iran is just a year later. Hamas, an Iranian proxy, has been decimated. Israel has shown that it can reach into a VIP guest house in Tehran to kill Hamas\u2019s leaders. Hezbollah, the crown jewel of Iran\u2019s proxy network, has been mauled to the point where Iran needs to strike Israel on the group\u2019s behalf, rather than vice versa. Israel\u2019s fractured political spectrum doesn\u2019t agree on much, but it is united when it comes to making Iran pay for its missile attacks on the country. The Abraham Accords\u2014which normalized Israel\u2019s relationship with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain\u2014are strained but remain intact, and Saudi-Israeli normalization remains possible in the longer term, even if it is not in the cards right now. In fact, despite the violence, it is easier to fly to Tel Aviv from Dubai than from many European cities. And the U.S. military is once again surging into the region. Further Western sanctions relief\u2014in this geopolitical climate\u2014is currently off the table. While Israel faces strategic problems of its own, at least Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can argue that he did not start this war. By contrast, it is an open question to what extent Iran\u2019s leaders helped plan the Oct. 7 attack and set the region aflame in the process. Even if Iran was merely caught up in one of its proxies going rogue, it certainly did have a direct role in the missile barrages against Israel and, by extension, the retaliatory strikes that followed. Perhaps the silver lining for Iran here is that it could have been worse. Tehran\u2019s missile attacks\u2014in April and again in October\u2014failed to kill Israelis or cause significant damage. Had they done that, Israel\u2019s retaliation would likely have been significantly more robust. But this gets to the crux: Iran\u2019s tolerance for risk is growing. Firing hundreds of ballistic missiles at a militarily superior adversary is a dangerous game. Firing them while repeatedly calling for the annihilation of a likely nuclear-armed, militarily superior, superpower-backed state with a right-wing government inclined to hit back hard is a potentially suicidal gamble. That\u2019s not the only thing Iran has done over the past year that was so risky that it could have threatened the regime\u2019s stability itself, had it not been for Tehran\u2019s incompetence. Iran reportedly tried to kill former U.S. President Donald Trump and other former senior Trump administration officials in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Quds Force leader Qassem Suleimani. Thankfully, those plots were foiled. But the attempt itself was a huge risk, especially given that Trump is a current candidate for the presidency and known for holding grievances. Indeed, after being briefed about the attempted assassination, Trump threatened to \u201cblow [Iran\u2019s] largest cities and the country itself to smithereens\u201d if he gets back to the White House and Iran tried a similar ploy. But whereas trying to assassinate a former\u2014and potentially future\u2014U.S. president on American soil is a gutsy move, imagine what would happen if such a plot actually succeeds. Republicans\u2014many of whom are already pretty hawkish on Iran\u2014would likely be calling for blood. Democrats would not likely let the killing of a former U.S. president go unpunished. Indeed, if one thing could upend the post-Iraq, post-Afghanistan received wisdom of eschewing regime change in the Middle East, killing a former president could be it. In short, if the Iranian regime survives this war, it will be thanks to luck and its own incompetence. Of course, from the Iranian perspective, its actions\u2014or at least its missile strikes\u2014were driven by strategic necessities to reestablish deterrence after a series of Israeli and U.S. affronts to its sovereignty, such as striking Iranian diplomatic facilities in Syria and killing Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leaders. But there is little evidence that Iranian actions are having any deterrent effect whatsoever. If anything, Israeli leaders are talking even more openly than before about regime change in Tehran and even more adamantly about destroying the Iranian nuclear program. Strategically, the wisest option for Iran right now would be to retreat to the shadows, rebuild its proxy network, and fight another day. After all, it will take time to rebuild Hamas and Hezbollah into the formidable fighting forces they once were. At the same time, Israel\u2019s ties to its Arab neighbors and the West are already frayed, thanks to the bloodshed of the Gaza campaign and the Netanyahu administration\u2019s unwillingness to commit to any sort of Palestinian state\u2014a win, if a Pyrrhic one, for Iran. Pulling back also leaves open the prospect of some sort of future deal with the West over the medium term\u2014which Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says he wants and even Trump says he\u2019s open to supporting. That is not, however, what Iran seems intent on doing. Whether it\u2019s because of Iranian domestic politics, concerns about losing face on the international stage, or simply a desire for revenge, the regime looks intent on doubling down. In a rare Friday prayer speech, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei\u2014with a rifle by his side in case anyone missed the point\u2014praised the Oct. 7 massacre and promised that Iran \u201cwon\u2019t back down. Israel won\u2019t last long.\u201d Iran\u2019s seeming unwillingness to reverse course has important implications for the United States and the West\u2019s approach to Iran. It raises the question of whether threatening Iran with further costs will be sufficient to force a change in direction. The United States and its European partners can sanction Iran all they want; Israel could bomb Iranian oil fields. But it may not change Iranian behavior. If deterrence by punishment won\u2019t work, then the United States and the West will need to resort to deterrence by denial\u2014destroying Iran\u2019s ability to attack Israel and aid its proxies. That would be hard to do, since it requires destroying significant chunks of Iran\u2019s military capabilities rather than simply threatening to inflict pain. But if the Iranian regime seems intent on escalating, then the United States and its allies may have no other choice. And if that happens, while this year may have been a terrible one for Iran, next year might be even worse.",

                    "post_content": "A year ago, in the wake of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack, U.S. President Joe Biden traveled to Tel Aviv and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reiterate his administration\u2019s unwavering support for Israel. Biden\u2019s embrace of Netanyahu was rooted in the belief that only positive inducements and constant reassurances\u2014both militarily and diplomatically\u2014could restrain Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. In reality, though, this \u201cbear hug\u201d diplomacy has resulted in an unmitigated failure. Since the onset of Israel\u2019s offensive campaign in Gaza, the Biden administration has pursued four policy objectives: supporting Israel\u2019s military campaign to eliminate the security threat posed by Hamas; helping to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza; mitigating harm to Palestinian civilians; and preventing an all-out war in the region. A year later, however, more than 42,000 Palestinians are dead, and most of Gaza is in ruins, with its 2 million inhabitants facing one of the worst humanitarian disasters of this century. Israel has failed to achieve its stated goal of completely eliminating Hamas, and some 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza. Meanwhile, U.S.-sponsored cease-fire talks between Israel and Hamas have all but collapsed, even as the war has now spread to Lebanon, and the threat of a wider war with Iran looms on the horizon. Although Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran clearly bear responsibility for the ongoing violence, the Biden administration must also accept blame as the most powerful foreign-policy actor in the region and the chief enabler of the war. Despite the Biden administration\u2019s often public frustration with Israel at being repeatedly defied and left in the dark, by continuing to provide Israel with unrestricted political and military support it has undermined its own diplomacy and brought us to the brink of an all-out regional war. While previous U.S. administrations, both Democrat and Republican, have been highly deferential to Israel, Biden has been unique in his uncompromising, almost fundamentalist, refusal to use U.S. leverage or apply any meaningful pressure on Israel. This has resulted in an incoherent U.S. policy that is jarringly disconnected from realities on the ground\u2014as well as the administration\u2019s own policy objectives. Biden\u2019s bear hug approach toward Israel has gone through various iterations over the past year. For the first few months of the war, Washington offered unconditional support for Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, while rejecting any and all calls for a cease-fire, including vetoing three separate cease-fire resolutions at the United Nations Security Council. Despite a skyrocketing death toll and what human rights observers deemed a \u201cshocking disregard for civilian lives\u201d by Israeli forces, the Biden White House repeatedly stressed that the United States would not draw any \u201cred lines\u201d when it came to Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza. Even as U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned Israel that the massive civilian toll risked replacing a \u201ctactical victory with a strategic defeat,\u201d Washington continued to fast-track weapons to Israel. So grave were Israeli excesses that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that there was a \u201cplausible\u201d case for genocide in Gaza. One month into the war, the U.S. State Department dutifully laid out its postwar vision for Gaza\u2014no forcible displacement, no reoccupation of Gaza or reduction of its territory, and returning control to a \u201crevitalized\u201d Palestinian Authority\u2014while pretending Netanyahu\u2019s words and Israeli bombs were not already foreclosing almost all of these. The administration\u2019s lack of urgency stemmed, in part, from Israeli assurances that the war would be wrapped up by early 2024. However, as the war dragged on and the humanitarian conditions in Gaza worsened dramatically, the Biden administration had to readjust. By February, the United States had shifted away from its overt opposition to any cease-fire to embracing a limited cease-fire-for-hostages deal. At the same time, U.S. officials became more vocal in their frustrations with Israel\u2019s conduct, occasionally warning of implicit consequences, though without any meaningful follow-through. Even as Biden described Israel\u2019s bombing campaign as \u201cover the top\u201d and \u201cindiscriminate\u201d (implicitly invoking the two standards of international humanitarian law: distinction and proportionality), his administration continued to fast-track weapons to Israel. As U.S. officials pleaded for Israel to do more to protect civilians and allow aid to Gaza\u2019s devastated population, humanitarian groups such as Human Rights Watch and Save the Children concluded that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of war. To bypass Israeli restrictions, the United States resorted to extraordinary measures including aid airdrops and the construction of a $230 million floating pier\u2014however both of these were eventually abandoned. Then, in early April, following Israeli airstrikes on a World Central Kitchen convoy that killed seven international aid workers, including a U.S. citizen, the Biden administration issued an unusually harsh ultimatum\u2014if the United States did not see changes in Israel\u2019s conduct, there would be a change in U.S. policy. Apart from a brief uptick in aid, however, very little changed. Two decisive moments further confirmed that the U.S. government was never serious about consequences for Israel. The first was the administration\u2019s report on National Security Memorandum-20, which required cuts in military assistance to countries that used U.S.-made weapons in violation of international humanitarian law and U.S. law. Despite overwhelming evidence of Israel\u2019s widespread and egregious violations of international law, including the blocking of humanitarian aid, the report evaded the issue by saying it was simply too hard to make \u201cdefinitive assessments\u201d about Israel\u2019s compliance. (A week later, the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor, Karim A.A. Khan, announced he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as well as three Hamas leaders for war crimes.) The second decisive factor was Israel\u2019s offensive campaign in Rafah, the border town in southern Gaza where most of the strip\u2019s population had been ordered to relocate, following the destruction of Gaza City and Khan Younis. Fearing a humanitarian disaster, Biden declared that an assault on Rafah would cross a \u201cred line\u201d and warned of consequences if Israel went ahead with the invasion. When Israeli tanks entered Rafah in early May, the administration announced that it was withholding thousands of 2,000- and 500-pound bombs that had turned most of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure to rubble. After months of tension over Gaza, the stage was now set for a major showdown between Biden and Netanyahu\u2014or so it seemed. Just two weeks into the operation, the administration folded. The Rafah invasion, the White House insisted, was in fact not an invasion but rather a \u201cmore targeted and limited\u201d operation\u2014albeit one in which nearly half of all structures were destroyed. Having successfully called Biden\u2019s bluff on Rafah and repeatedly defied the U.S. president with impunity, Netanyahu and his far-right government understood that they would now have a free hand to prosecute and even escalate the war as they saw fit. While Hamas has repeatedly dragged its feet in cease-fire negotiations, it is widely believed that Netanyahu has sought to prolong and even expand the war in order to maintain his grip on power\u2014including by authorizing the assassination of head Hamas negotiator Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran as well as adding new demands to a potential deal. Israel\u2019s expansion of the war into Lebanon throughout the summer and especially in the last few weeks is the latest example of Biden\u2019s self-undermining approach. On one hand, Biden had repeatedly warned Israel against an all-out invasion of Lebanon, which could push Iran over the edge and drag the region into a disastrous conflict. At the same time, U.S. officials assured Israeli leaders that they would continue to back Israel no matter what. This muddled message has been a godsend for Netanyahu, who has consistently ignored the former while embracing the latter. Since mid-September, Israeli operations in Lebanon, including the exploding pagers attack and the airstrikes that killed Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, have proceeded at an almost dizzying pace and left more than 2,100 people dead and nearly a million displaced. Though miffed at once again being left in the dark, U.S. officials welcomed Nasrallah\u2019s death as a \u201cmeasure of justice\u201d while making no mention of Lebanese civilians or the laws of war. Still, Israeli officials insisted they did not seek an all-out war with Hezbollah but rather were pursuing \u201cde-escalation through escalation,\u201d a rather Orwellian turn of phrase the Biden White House nevertheless embraced. When Iran\u2019s inevitable retaliation came, a barrage of some 180 missiles fired at various targets across Israel, U.S. officials responded with both outrage and dismissal, calling the attack ineffectual while joining Israel in promising \u201csevere consequences.\u201d The Biden administration has now become an active participant in the very outcome it had spent months warning against and working to prevent. Whereas only weeks ago it had been frantically working to negotiate a cease-fire in Lebanon, the administration\u00a0has now openly embraced an Israeli bombing campaign\u00a0and invasion that it once cautioned against. This result was probably inevitable. Biden\u2019s overriding impulse to align U.S. objectives with Israel\u2019s, even when it was clear that the two diverged, invariably led to an incoherent and failed U.S. policy. By working to ensure that Israel enjoyed total impunity, even when it acted in ways the United States strongly opposed, the administration consistently undercut its own cease-fire diplomacy while allowing Netanyahu to expand the war. The one area where Biden\u2019s policy could claim a measure of success\u2014helping Israel to restore its deterrent against its enemies\u2014is likely to be short-lived given the unparalleled death, destruction, and generational trauma inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza and now being extended to Lebanon. Although Israel has severely degraded the military capabilities of both Hamas and Hezbollah, this has come at enormous cost\u2014in human, material, reputational, moral, and even security terms\u2014to the Middle East, the United States, and even itself. Lest we forget, Hezbollah and Hamas did not emerge in a vacuum but as a response to conditions on the ground, namely the Israeli occupation and repression of Palestinians and Israel\u2019s 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The idea that Israelis could bomb their way into security has never panned out, as history has shown. The Biden administration\u2019s single-minded focus on Israeli demands, needs, and pain has blinded it not only to the humanity of Palestinians and Lebanese but to the long-term damage done to the region, U.S. interests, and even Israeli security. It is not too late to prevent further damage, including an all-out regional war. But this will require a fundamental shift away from the current administration\u2019s approach. Given the Biden administration\u2019s rigidity and inability to adapt to realities on the ground over the past year, the current regional turmoil will almost certainly continue into the next U.S. administration. No matter the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, Washington will need to use the vast leverage it already has\u2014most notably by conditioning weapons transfers and other military assistance to Israel on its compliance with the basic tenets of international law as required by U.S. law. More importantly, U.S. officials should make clear to all parties that there is no military solution to this conflict and that genuine Israeli security could only come via a political settlement that addresses the root causes of the conflict\u2014namely the systematic denial of Palestinian rights under an increasingly violent occupation. Otherwise, the very \u201cstrategic defeat\u201d that Austin warned of will apply not just to Israel but to the United States as well.",

                    "post_content": "The Israeli killing of Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas and the key architect of the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks that killed almost 1,200 people, may prove to be more of an anti-climax than a turning point in the Israel-Gaza war. The killing is yet another indicator that Israel has devastated Hamas as an organization, but both Hamas and Israel appear ready to continue fighting, and Israel has yet to resolve the harder question of what should come next in Gaza. Sinwar had been a leading member of Hamas from the group\u2019s inception. He spent many years in prison until a 2011 prisoner swap and was known for his militant views. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, Israel has made him public enemy number one, declaring him a \u201cdead man walking\u201d early in the war\u2014a promise that, after a year of brutal conflict, Israel made good on. In theory, Sinwar\u2019s death might make a cease-fire more likely. He took a hard-line stance on negotiations, seeking to prolong the war because it hurt Israel\u2019s international reputation and relationship with its key ally, the United States. He was also willing for ordinary Gazans to suffer, immensely, to achieve his ends. From Israel\u2019s point of view, killing Sinwar is a political victory, a visceral reminder of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s promise to destroy Hamas. With his death\u2014along with those of other key planners of the Oct. 7 attack, such as military wing leader Mohammed Deif and his deputy Marwan Issa\u2014much of Hamas\u2019s Gaza leadership is destroyed. Hamas is also devastated outside Gaza, most notably by Israel\u2019s killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July but also due to other attacks on leaders in Lebanon and elsewhere. Israel has also decimated much of Hamas\u2019s rank and file. Among the 42,000 or more Gazans who Israel has killed, Israel claims that more than a third were Hamas fighters\u2014huge losses for an organization whose fighting total was believed to be between 25,000 and 30,000 before Oct. 7. Israel has also removed Hamas as a governing force in Gaza, depriving the organization of an important source of money, power, and legitimacy. It will be hard for Hamas to recover from these blows. The loss of many senior, experienced leaders will bring less-experienced individuals to the fore, and they will have to prove themselves to Hamas\u2019s foreign backers, supporters in Gaza and other Palestinian communities, and their own rank and file. The constant killing campaign makes it dangerous for Hamas leaders to communicate and, consequently, difficult for them to run their own organization: They could communicate and direct their teams only by risking the fate of Sinwar, Deif, and many others. Curtailing communication, however, leaves Hamas untethered at a critical time, with no clear guidance on what the organization should do next other than stagger on. Hamas\u2019s popularity in Gaza is also suffering, as Palestinians there, along with blaming Israel for the destruction, are also angry at Hamas for provoking the Israeli bear. What kind of Hamas will rise from Sinwar\u2019s ashes? On the one hand, the devastating Israeli campaign against Hamas and Gaza is a lesson for future leaders about the perils of confronting a much stronger, determined foe. Hamas would benefit from time to regroup and rebuild its organization and try to reverse the decline in its support. On the other hand, future Hamas leaders might double down on what they would call resistance. Under Sinwar\u2019s leadership Hamas hit Israel hard, put the Palestinian issue back on the political map, and damaged the country\u2019s international reputation: Ending the struggle might set these gains back. After the loss of so many leaders and fighters, as well as the deaths of so many Palestinian children and other noncombatants, organization members also have a thirst for revenge. Israel, for its part, shows little sign that it will let up on Hamas. Its rhetorical commitment to destroying Hamas is matched by its actions on the ground. Hamas endures, and the organization has recovered from major leadership losses in the past. Although many Israelis favor a cease-fire in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages, the Netanyahu administration has made continued operations against Hamas its priority. For Israel, killing Sinwar does not solve the broader problem of governance in Gaza. More than a year after Oct. 7, Israel is no closer to conceptualizing, let alone implementing, a realistic framework for who will govern Gaza. A failed state is the most likely near, and perhaps long-term outcome for Gaza. In such an environment, Hamas, even if weak and disorganized, will be able to endure and perhaps even prosper. Ordinary Gazans, of course, will find no relief from war and misery.",

                    "post_content": "Last week, an Israeli patrol in southern Gaza chanced upon the person who had been at the very top of their kill list for more than a year: Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. When his death was confirmed, it immediately raised some big questions: How much of a blow would this be for Hamas? How should Israel\u2019s strategy now change? And if Sinwar was the person Israel was blaming for a lack of progress on a hostage deal, would removing him change that equation? Big moments in a war can feel defining. But as several writers at Foreign Policy have argued, Sinwar\u2019s death might not be the turning point many imagine. There\u2019s a long history of states killing leaders of militant or terrorist groups only to see another leader step in.\u00a0 How should Israel calibrate its strategy after killing Sinwar? And, similarly, what changes after killing Beirut-based Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah? I spoke with Gen. David Petraeus to try and get at some of the dilemmas inherent in gaming out wartime strategy. Petraeus ended a 37-year military career running the United States Central Command, which includes all of the Middle East, Central Asia, and parts of South Asia. He was deeply involved in combating terrorist groups in those regions amid the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Petraeus later had a short stint as CIA director under the Obama administration.\u00a0 Subscribers can watch the full discussion in the video box atop this page. What follows here is an edited and condensed transcript.\u00a0 Ravi Agrawal: Let\u2019s start with the death of Yahya Sinwar. From your experience with counterterrorism in the Middle East, how does this actually impact Hamas\u2019s capabilities? David Petraeus: Well, it\u2019s a huge blow. Symbolically, this is massive. Operationally, it\u2019s significant, as well. He had to be exercising considerable operational security given how much the Israelis were pursuing him. But he still was the individual who was saying yes or no, really no, on cease-fire deals. He was the ultimate authority, however difficult it was to get to him, or for him to get to his subordinate commanders in very seriously degraded units. This is still a very, very significant achievement for the Israelis. And how interesting that it was a patrol that chanced upon him, not a special mission unit operation. But there will be another leader. Some are speculating that it could be his younger brother, Mohammed. I\u2019m not sure that they\u2019ll have the combined political and military leader in the next leader that you had with Sinwar. Perhaps [Khaled] Mashal in Qatar will take over the political role like Haniyeh before he was killed in Tehran. But it is very disruptive and it\u2019s yet another very significant achievement in the degradation of Hamas. But Hamas has not yet been destroyed. Keep in mind that there were three objectives set out by the prime minister at the beginning of operations in response to the horrific tragedy of Oct. 7, the mastermind of which was Sinwar. And these were to destroy Hamas, ensure Hamas never governs Gaza again, and, of course, get back the hostages. Number one and two are in big tension with number three. Destruction means that you cannot reconstitute. Israel is conducting the equivalent of \u201cclear and leave\u201d operations, similar to what we were doing in 2006 in Iraq. And when the surge began, we recognized that only we could provide security for the people and therefore we had to clear areas and then hold them, and then rebuild them, and restore basic services, etc. In the absence of those kinds of operations, reoccupying Gaza by the Israelis, there is neither security nor a denial of Hamas\u2019s ability to reconstitute, nor a denial of Hamas\u2019s ability to influence or govern in the way that they used to. And, of course, the Palestinian people are in a very, very desperate situation. There is really a humanitarian catastrophe in many areas where people have been displaced multiple times. Issues like hygiene, water, and food security are really quite desperate. Another very significant Israeli achievement is the control of the southern border between Gaza and the Sinai, the so-called Philadelphi Corridor, including the Rafah crossing. Much of the weapon systems, ammunition, explosives, and then materiel used by Hamas to build this extensive 350-mile underground infrastructure came through that crossing and through the tunnels under that corridor. I think they have to hang on to that. It should not be bargained away. RA: That, of course, general, is an issue of debate right now. It\u2019s a sticking point in the negotiations. DP: This is why I think it\u2019s unlikely to see a cease-fire. What Hamas will want in these negotiations is for Israel to leave Gaza for all time and give up control of the Philadelphi Corridor. Neither of those can be acceptable to Israel. They have not completed the destruction of Hamas. They haven\u2019t ensured that Hamas cannot reconstitute. There\u2019s plenty of recruits out there, given the damage and destruction that have been part of this campaign to degrade Hamas. And then, of course, it has no vision for the Palestinian people. And from the beginning, I\u2019ve noted that there really needs to be a vision for the future of Gaza because that could guide the military as they\u2019re crafting their campaign. RA: General, on that point, you\u2019re taking me back to almost exactly one year ago when we had a very similar conversation like this on FP Live. I was looking back at that conversation, when you said that military action was necessary for Israel, but then added that vengeance isn\u2019t a strategy and that there has to be a vision for what follows. When you look back at the last year of Israel\u2019s response to Oct. 7, did they follow your advice? DP: Certainly some, but not all of it. And that\u2019s why this campaign is still incomplete if you measure it against the actual stated objectives. I don\u2019t think that a strategy of \u201cclear and leave\u201d is going to ensure the destruction of Hamas, nor will it provide a better future for the Palestinian people. And you\u2019ll recall during the surge, we would go to the citizens of Fallujah, and we would tell them in advance that we are going to make your lives better by getting al Qaeda and the Sunni insurgent organizations out of your lives, and then keep them out by creating walled-off neighborhoods in which you painstakingly clear every building room, cellar, and, in this case, tunnel. You issue biometric ID cards, which allows them to come and go. And then, in an organized fashion not possible in Gaza right now, you can pump in substantial humanitarian assistance, begin the restoration of basic services, get people back at least in the vicinity of their homes, and then start improving their lives. So it\u2019s \u201cclear, hold, and build.\u201d If that\u2019s done, then you\u2019ll see Arab forces willing to come in. You could bring in Palestinian security forces that are trained and equipped by the United States and the Jordanians at the International Police Training center. You\u2019ll see NGOs and international organizations in there. And only if there is security can you do what I\u2019ve laid out, and only then is there a better future for the Palestinian people with the possibility that Palestinians in Gaza can live side by side with their Israeli neighbors in peace. It\u2019s really vital that Israelis take advantage of the opportunity presented by the killing of Yahya Sinwar by announcing, \u201cThis is our plan to achieve our objectives and to improve the lives for our fellow human beings, the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d I believe that if Gazans are provided a better life in this approach that I have described, I think that the Palestinian people\u2014just like the people of Fallujah and Ramadi, Baqouba, Mosul, and others\u2014will recognize that, \u201cWe should not jeopardize this by allowing extremists to ever run our communities again.\u201d That remains to be seen. There are those who may argue that is not possible. But if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019re in a really difficult situation. RA: We\u2019re in a difficult situation, anyway. What advice would you have, in this scenario, where everything you\u2019re saying just strikes me as something that the Palestinian people will hear and reject? DP: During the first four months of the surge, all the metrics tracking civilian deaths, suicide bombings, our own casualties, were going down. But people came out to Iraq and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a bit of a PR problem out here.\u201d And I said, \u201cReally? That\u2019s not a PR problem. It\u2019s a results problem. And when the results are demonstrably undeniable, the PR problem is going to go away.\u201d Now the damage and destruction in Gaza is much greater, frankly. The tunnels have required use of very large munitions that can penetrate the ground to get at them. But you have to start somewhere. My suggestion has been to start in the north and work your way south, creating this series of gated communities. It\u2019s hard, but I believe it is the only solution that achieves the first two objectives of Israel and over time will achieve the third. Because once you have combed every building, room, cellar, and tunnel, you will get the hostages and also provide a better future for the Palestinian people and a possibility of a sustainable situation at the end of all of this loss of life, and bloodshed, and sacrifice. RA: Let me ask you a military question. When you look at the death toll in Gaza and the growing one in Lebanon, how much of this was avoidable? It\u2019s a fraught question. DP: A very fraught question. Look, I had people looking over my shoulder and second-guessing me, and I\u2019m reluctant to do that. It\u2019s always about the military imperative and then always trying to minimize civilian casualties, damage, and destruction of infrastructure. But that military imperative can be so significant that you still have to carry out an operation, sometimes knowing that there is going to be loss of innocent civilian life. Without being inside, it\u2019s very hard to judge. We do know that the damage and destruction is very considerable. We know the magnitude of the loss of civilian life. We know that loss of particularly women and children, who are not likely to have been members of extremist organizations, is considerable. Because of that loss, there\u2019s a lot of potential recruits for Hamas, too. There\u2019s a great deal of public popular resentment, and that\u2019s going to have to be dealt with over time. And the way to deal with it is show you care about them and that you want to make their lives much better, so much better that they don\u2019t ever want Hamas back in their lives, recalling that it was Hamas that brought this on them. RA: Behind a lot of this, of course, is Iran. There\u2019s a big debate in D.C. about how to manage Iran\u2019s role in funding groups like Hamas or Hezbollah. There are also calls from some quarters to take this opportunity and attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, especially now that Hezbollah has been degraded. Others say those calls are completely foolhardy because America would get involved and that would just lead to a big regional war. Where do you fall on that debate? \u00a0DP: The risk of that would be very considerable. The United States has to be involved because there are certain targets that only we can deal with. It\u2019s publicly out there [that] in response to the 180 ballistic missiles that Iran shot from their territory to Israel, Israel intends to strike military targets. I think that is appropriate. And I strongly believe that Iran should never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Our stated policy from Republican or Democratic administrations for decades has been that we will not allow them to do that. And presumably, if they were to enrich weapons-grade [uranium], the level of enrichment that they\u2019re just below, I actually am confident that the United States would ensure that they cannot create a nuclear device. But at this juncture, given the possibility of further escalation, the right approach is what reportedly has been agreed between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. They\u2019ve agreed to a substantial attack against military-related targets to degrade and destroy a lot of the capabilities that Iran has built up that threaten Israel so significantly, as we have seen in the course of the two attacks that they have launched against Israel. I assume that as soon as the U.S.-provided THAAD system is set, they\u2019ll be confident in their ability to defend against whatever it is that Iran might send back their way. Iran is going to have to make a tough decision here because it can keep going. RA: There\u2019s another strategic element to this. The United States and Israel are trying to isolate Iran in every single way they can. But Iran seems to be winning friends in the Arab world. It seems now that the images of war in Gaza, and now increasingly Lebanon, are bringing these two great rivals, Iran and Saudi, closer together. Is that your read, as well? DP: I think it\u2019s selective. I think it\u2019s very transactional, frankly. There\u2019s certainly no love lost for Iran in Riyadh or Jeddah. The real issue here was that the Saudis were getting very tired of having Iran-sourced projectiles shot at them by the Houthis from Yemen. It was clear to them that the Sunnis were not going to be able to prevail in the way that Saudis and the Emiratis had hoped in the Yemeni civil war. The Houthis proved to be quite resilient and tough. And they recognized that this is time to put an end to that. Remember, there was an attack on the Abqaiq oil facility that shut down the production of about 5 percent of the world\u2019s crude oil. And ironically, at that time, we did not respond. It wasn\u2019t until an American was killed in Iraq that we took out Qassem Soleimani. That was unsettling to them. So you have these transactional issues on which they are willing to negotiate or discuss with Iran. And I think that makes sense. But the overall feeling is still one of an enormous enmity. There used to be three truths for Central Command when I was the commander. First is be very clear on who your enemies are and who your friends are. And Iran is an enemy. At the end of the day, they have sworn to destroy Israel and the U.S. presence in the Middle East. Number two is recognize that Las Vegas rules do not apply in the Middle East. What happens there doesn\u2019t stay there. It tends to spew violence, extremism, instability, and, on occasion, tsunamis of refugees into neighboring countries and as far as the countries of our European allies. And then the third is we constantly are trying to leave the Middle East to pivot to Asia, which is a terrible term, because it\u2019s very unsettling to your friends and emboldens your enemies. But leaving the Middle East is like Michael Corleone trying to leave the mafia. You just keep getting sucked back in. So recognize that. Have the kind of presence that is necessary. No more than that. But enough to reassure your friends. RA: If you look back at American policy in the Middle East since 9/11, the reality is that America has lost so much soft power. It has hurt America\u2019s ability to do other things it wants to do around the world; it has diminished its standing at multilateral organizations. You could argue that Israel now is going through something similar. And I can\u2019t stress this enough. If you set aside the Arab world for a minute, throughout the rest of the world, there is vast disenchantment with how Israel and the United States have responded to Oct. 7. If you were still in the military or in government, what would you advise? DP: Well, start with where this began, which was the horrific, traumatic day. The most traumatic day for Israel in its history, the worst intelligence failure, the worst military-readiness failure, and the worst political analytical failure in the complete misjudgment of Hamas. And that\u2019s the first of the fronts in which Israel is now engaged. Start by laying out a vision for how you bring that to a decent end, how you achieve your objectives relative to Hamas and getting the hostages back and providing a better future for the Palestinian people, and do it. If you actually start to resolve Gaza in a favorable way for the people there by getting them out of this humanitarian disaster zone, the cause motivating Hezbollah will just not present. Plus, they\u2019ve sustained enormous damage. Israel has decapitated Hezbollah, taking out some 18 of the top 20 leaders, including the heir apparent to Nasrallah. They\u2019ve decimated the entire leadership structure because the leaders were the ones that had the pagers. And if Israel can continue reducing Hezbollah\u2019s capacity with the airstrikes and ensure that Hezbollah can\u2019t use that territory between the Litani River and the northern border, that would allow the 65,000 Israeli citizens to go home to northern Israel. Then, I think there\u2019s going to be some kind of cease-fire deal that could be acceptable, and even desirable, compared with where Israel and Hezbollah were prior. Then figure out what to do with Iran. You\u2019re going to have to diminish the Houthis further, and then we can walk our way around the rest of the Gulf. Saudi Arabia is still, I think, eager to join the Abraham Accords, to recognize Israel and to have the kind of exchanges with Israel that the Emiratis and Bahrainis are enjoying. And over time, again, a better future for the Palestinian people\u2014not just in Gaza but also in the West Bank. It\u2019s going to take a long time but every long journey starts with a single step.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Israeli troops would face a battle-hardened enemy while trying to get tens of thousands of civilians out of the way.",
                    "post_content": "Despite an ongoing eleventh-hour attempt to secure a cease-fire in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said on Monday that Israel\u2019s war cabinet had unanimously decided to proceed with its military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which Israeli officials say is Hamas\u2019s last major holdout.\u00a0 Even as top United Nations officials have warned that a Rafah invasion could push the 1.5 million Palestinians who have encamped there over the border into Egypt\u2014essentially making resolving the conflict impossible\u2014Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops on Sunday that an invasion is imminent.\u00a0 And early Monday, the Israeli military began preparing the battlefield with airstrikes on Rafah, signaling a possible imminent ground operation; it also ordered 100,000 Palestinians\u2014just a fraction of those sheltering in Rafah\u2014to evacuate to an Israeli-established humanitarian zone along the Mediterranean coast.\u00a0 If Israeli troops do advance into Rafah in an attempt to eradicate the four Hamas battalions believed to be there, experts say they will face a battle-hardened enemy that has the ability to fight and resupply through a vast network of tunnels, all while Israeli troops try to get tens of thousands\u2014if not millions\u2014of civilians out of the way.\u00a0 In other cities where the IDF has fought since this war began, such as Khan Younis, troops were able to move neighborhood by neighborhood, sector by sector, clearing out people as they needed to. But larger masses of people will likely be forced out this time as the IDF moves in. \u201cRafah is going to fundamentally look a bit different,\u201d said Jonathan Lord, a senior fellow and the director of the Middle East security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank. It \u201cisn\u2019t quite as clean, necessarily.\u201d\u00a0 The Hamas battalions fighting in Rafah are \u201cfairly indigenous\u201d to the area, Lord said. They rely on the Philadelphi Corridor, a dense network of tunnels. The Israelis have tried to put in a subterranean wall to block Hamas\u2019s use of the corridor but haven\u2019t been successful.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHamas is most likely dug in and prepared to fight from emplaced positions where they have access to tunnels and resupply and the ability to exfiltrate and escape and move around,\u201d Lord said. \u201cThat becomes a little bit harder in some of the improvised humanitarian areas.\u201d\u00a0 Michael Mulroy, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense now working with Fogbow, a group helping to set up the aid pier in Gaza, said the Israelis have told NGOs that the evacuation will take about 10 days, though aid groups believe it could take substantially longer. Mulroy said the operation could shut down border crossings into Gaza for up to three to four weeks. Rafah, which borders Egypt, is home to the only border crossing into Gaza that Israel does not directly control. And it\u2019s not clear that the Israelis have set up enough temporary housing, hospitals, and security to make the evacuation workable. The Israeli government has begun setting up 40,000 tents in Mawasi, a beachside area where there are less likely to be Hamas tunnels, but humanitarian groups say that number is far short of what is needed.\u00a0 \u201cThe immediate conclusion is going to be, what are you going to do with all of these people?\u201d said Bilal Y. Saab, an associate fellow with Chatham House in London and a former U.S. defense official. Hamas might also want civilians in the way, analysts said, and could even potentially impede their exit. Some former military officials are even worried that the militant group could take human shields. \u201cYou need to reduce the number of civilians in there,\u201d said Kenneth McKenzie, a retired Marine general and the head of U.S. Central Command until 2022. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, Hamas will try to make that not happen. Hamas has no interest in evacuating civilians, regardless of what they say.\u201d\u00a0 Mulroy said the Israelis will need at least two divisions, a paratrooper and an armored element, alongside smaller detachments of artillery and special operations forces. But there are still high-level tactical arguments taking place between the Netanyahu and Biden administrations about how the campaign would be conducted.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a multidimensional fight,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to fight underground, they\u2019re going to have to fight on the surface of the Earth, they\u2019re going to have to fight in the low-Earth atmosphere, because Hamas will probably fly lots of drones. Israel will certainly fly drones. It\u2019s going to be another tough, bloody, ugly fight, which Israel will have lessons learned from their fights [in northern Gaza]. Hamas will have lessons learned from the fights up north. Both sides will apply them.\u201d In a phone call with Netanyahu on Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden reiterated his opposition to a Rafah ground operation, and White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Israel had not yet provided the United States with a comprehensive plan for its operations in Rafah.\u00a0 \u201cThe U.S. would like to see [Rafah] as more of a surgical, intel-driven probe with reconnaissance [to] find the mass of Hamas fighting militants and then streamline your combat power directly to it,\u201d Mulroy said. \u201cThe Israelis\u2014at least from what I know\u2014are [planning for] more like a Fallujah-type, mass movement, block-to-block fight,\u201d he added, referencing the pitched urban battles that U.S. troops fought in Iraq following the 2003 invasion.\u00a0 Whether Netanyahu and his war cabinet will end up being receptive to Washington\u2019s wishes or instead choose to forge ahead and do things their own way remains to be seen. But experts aren\u2019t holding out much hope. \u201cHave they actually decided to further alienate the Americans?\u201d Saab said. \u201cWe keep telling them, don\u2019t do it, and [Netanyahu] is about to do it.\u201d",

                    "post_excerpt": "Washington\u2019s shortsighted policies enabled Tehran and its proxies to destabilize the region.",
                    "post_content": "The United States has dropped the ball on Iran. Had Washington come up with a comprehensive strategy to address Tehran\u2019s destabilizing role in the Middle East, the spreading conflict between Iran and its proxies on the one side and Israel and its allies on the other might have been prevented. Today\u2019s escalating conflict in the Middle East\u2014which on April 13 saw the first-ever direct attack on Israel by Iran\u2014is not least the result of an inconsistent, shortsighted, and overly compartmentalized U.S. policy toward Iran for more than a decade. Since the first administration of President Barack Obama, Washington has focused its attention almost entirely on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, all but overlooking its other activities\u2014including its interventions across the region. Already during Obama\u2019s campaign for his first term in 2008, he promised to make a nuclear deal with Iran his top priority for the Middle East, which he duly sought to implement once in office. Early in the process, there was a clear imbalance between Washington\u2019s perception and Tehran\u2019s. Washington thought that engaging Iran on the nuclear file would curb the latter\u2019s destabilizing potential in the region, and this assumption motivated the signing of an initial nuclear agreement with Iran in 2013. But Iran celebrated the agreement as a political victory and otherwise carried on. Despite this, the Obama administration pressed on in pursuit of a wider nuclear deal, and in 2015 managed to secure the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). As the Obama administration was negotiating its deals, two significant developments took place in Iran that failed to set off any kind of rethink in Washington. The first was the Green Movement, a nationwide wave of protests against the manipulated 2009 election that gave Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term. The Iranian authorities crushed the movement with sheer violence. In 2011, popular protests also erupted in Syria as part of the Arab Spring. Iran was quick to deploy its advisors to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad crush the protests, turning a peaceful uprising into a long and bloody war that continues to this day. During this time, Iran was also developing its ballistic missile program. But none of these developments shifted Washington\u2019s focus away from the objective of the nuclear deal. Once again, U.S. and Iranian perceptions varied greatly. Washington\u2019s logic was that nuclear enrichment was the greatest threat that Iran was posing in the Middle East\u2014and the U.S. side theorized that cooperation on this issue, in return for lifting sanctions, would build trust. This trust, according to Washington, would then be the basis upon which Iran could be engaged on other issues such as its missile program and its interventions in the Middle East. This misplaced hope not only failed to account for Iranian political realities, but it was also shortsighted in allowing Iran to expand both its missile program and regional interventions. This myopic fixation of the Obama years is today repeated by the Biden administration, which has been similarly focused on the nuclear deal while largely ignoring Iran\u2019s other destabilizing activities. But even the administration of former President Donald Trump did not deviate much from the path set by Obama and now followed by President Joe Biden. In 2018, Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA and announced the start of a so-called maximum pressure campaign toward Iran. Yet his administration did not come up with any plan for dealing with the ballistic missile program or regional interventions\u2014despite Iran\u2019s activities in Syria having become more extensive than they were during Obama\u2019s time in office. Iran never fully abided by the terms of the JCPOA, but the U.S. withdrawal from the deal gave Tehran the opportunity to publicly blame Washington, increasing Iran\u2019s political capital among its supporters. And although Trump used the term \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to describe his Iran strategy, the reality was that the measures taken by Washington were actually not very maximal. They amounted to the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)\u2014a branch of the Iranian military\u2014as a terrorist organization in 2019, the assassination of IRGC elite commander Qassem Suleimani in 2020, and the imposition of additional sanctions. The Trump administration\u2019s measures did not cause Iran to modify its behavior. If anything, Iran became more emboldened. The terrorist designation did little to curb the IRGC\u2019s financial transactions because the group does not rely on international banking networks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s declaration that the United States implemented the designation at his \u201crequest\u201d only served to support Iran\u2019s narrative that it was defying victimization by its enemies. Suleimani\u2019s assassination did not cause the IRGC to crumble, and it carried on its destabilizing activities. And while Iran did suffer financially from sanctions, they have not been sufficient to cause a change in the regime\u2019s behavior. Iran also benefited from the lukewarm reaction of the Trump administration to the attacks orchestrated by Iran and its proxies against U.S. targets in the Middle East. Washington blamed Tehran for the 2019 attack by Yemen\u2019s Houthis on a critical Aramco oil facility in Saudi Arabia\u2014but it never came up with a robust policy toward Yemen itself. That failure is now vividly playing out in the context of the Israel-Hamas war. In the eyes of Tehran, Washington also lost credibility due to its lack of political and military pushback. When IRGC speedboats harassed U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf in 2020, the United States chose not to respond. Later that year, the Trump administration failed in its bid to extend a U.N. arms embargo on Iran, which expired in October 2020; instead, Washington ended up imposing this embargo unilaterally. Iran saw this scenario as confirming the United States\u2019 diplomatic isolation. When Washington imposed more sanctions on Tehran that same year, the latter\u2019s response was to increase nuclear enrichment. Iran also benefited from U.S. inattention to the former\u2019s ongoing regional interventions, which continued across the administrations of Obama, Trump, and Biden. This inattention allowed the Houthis to consolidate their position in Yemen, helped the Assad regime stay in power, and enabled Hezbollah to become the most powerful political actor in Lebanon. Other Iran-backed armed groups in the Middle East, including Hamas, also profited from this situation, acquiring more weapons, funding, and training from Iran. After 15 years of half-baked, myopic U.S. policies toward Iran, it should not come as a surprise that the Middle East is now at war\u2014started on Oct. 7, 2023, by an Iran-backed armed group, Hamas, whose escalatory aggressiveness is, to no small extent, the result of a failed U.S. strategy toward Iran. Iran\u2019s apparent resilience is not simply the product of its own strength, but also largely a consequence of U.S. strategic ineptitude. In other words, U.S. behavior has aided Iran\u2019s ability to act as a destabilizing force in the Middle East. If there is a silver lining to the events since October, it is that the conflict has shown Iran to be isolated and vulnerable. When Iran attacked Israel, the latter\u2019s Western allies and Arab partners actively aided in its defense. Iran, for all its network of proxies, lacks such a robust defense network. This could be a golden opportunity for the United States to shift gears in its handling of Iran. A new strategy should include stronger engagement with Washington\u2019s regional allies to create a viable security framework for the Middle East, taking the lead on the Syrian and Yemeni peace processes, and resurrecting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in a way that includes and addresses Iran\u2019s role. Unfortunately, there are still no signs that the United States is prepared to craft a comprehensive Iran policy that seriously addresses Tehran\u2019s threat to regional stability. U.S. policy on Iran has echoes of its Syria policy, through which the Obama administration\u2019s inaction led to horrific consequences. As long as the United States maintains a similarly passive stance on Iran, the Middle East will continue to reel from Tehran\u2019s destabilizing actions.",

                    "post_content": "In the early hours of April 19, Israel\u2019s military struck deep inside Iran, at a military air base near Isfahan. Iran says it fended off a separate attack in Tabriz, about 500 miles north of Isfahan. All of this\u2014unprecedented as it is\u2014was a retaliation to Iran\u2019s own unprecedented attack on Israel on April 13, when Tehran launched hundreds of armed drones as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Israel. (And that, to get the sequence of events right, was in response to a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, Syria, on April 1.) Iran and Israel have long been engaged in a shadow war, using intermediaries to gnaw at each other and generally refraining from direct territorial attacks. The latest set of strikes and counterstrikes in April suggests a new phase in their struggle, opening up the possibility of more dangerous counterattacks and escalations. The latest episode of FP Live took place right before Israel\u2019s strike on Iran. What follows below is an edited and condensed portion of that discussion, focused on how Iran and Israel are navigating domestic pressures as they look to conduct their foreign policy. I spoke with Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution who has advised both Democratic and Republican administrations, and Ronen Bergman, an Israeli staff writer for the New York Times Magazine and Israeli paper Yedioth Ahronoth. Subscribers can watch the full interview in the video box atop this page or follow the FP Live podcast. Ravi Agrawal: Suzanne, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about the various domestic pressures that Iran is facing right now, from the hijab protests to economic concerns. And you also have succession planning underway for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Talk to us a little bit about how all of this plays into the decision-making in Tehran. Suzanne Maloney: I think that\u2019s a really important dimension to this issue. Iran\u2019s revolution is aging. And it is nearing a very, I think, significant succession process. The supreme leader is in his mid-80s. He has been in that position since 1989. And there is not a very clear successor. There are various candidates for that position, none of whom have a considerable amount of charisma or political skills. The current president, Ebrahim Raisi, is probably the best-known among those contenders. But he stands credibly accused of crimes against humanity in some of his prior positions and has demonstrated a fairly tone-deaf approach to some of the challenges that the country is facing. The other very well-known rumored successor who is often talked about is Mojtaba Khamenei, the son of the current supreme leader. That would, of course, invoke the precedent of the monarchy that the Islamic Revolution displaced. So I think that\u2019s probably not a likely outcome. But certainly, Mojtaba is a key figure within the system. So there\u2019s this debate about precisely how and when succession comes. More generally, there is turnover of leadership within the system itself because many members of the original revolutionary generation are now in their 70s and 80s. They have begun to pass from the scene. But they\u2019ve also begun to become excluded from political life, whether it\u2019s the former president, Hassan Rouhani, who was very much involved with the politics behind the 2015 nuclear deal or other senior figures who have been under house arrest for more than 15 years because of their support for reform within Iran. This is a system that is beginning to pass to the hands of a younger generation, to the battle-hardened veterans of the Revolutionary Guard, of the Iran-Iraq War, and of all the skirmishes that Iran has been involved with since that time. And what we\u2019ve seen is a real hardening of the system in the hands of these individuals. What happened last weekend, in many respects, was the culmination of a leadership that has been more inclined to adventurism, to risk tolerance. We know, of course, that they\u2019ve targeted former U.S. officials from the Trump administration, many of whom are still under protective custody. They\u2019ve targeted dissidents and others around the world, including some in the United States, in a very serious and dangerous fashion. They\u2019ve also, of course, expanded and entrenched their role across the region and their willingness to use violence to try to advance their own interests and aims. When I first studied in Iran and had an opportunity to understand that country 25 years ago, many of us anticipated a modest liberalization, some kind of reform that might gradually make Iran a more responsible player at home and on the international scene. That hasn\u2019t happened at all. And in fact, we\u2019ve seen just the opposite. RA: And Ronen, let me ask you about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s standing amid all of this. The protest movement against him had really picked up again in the last month or so. What kinds of domestic pressures is he facing? Ronen Bergman: Iran\u2019s strikes were seen by much of the Israeli public as just another failure of Netanyahu. Just another disaster. In a way, it\u2019s aligning some of the public behind the military or the defense establishment (although trust in those institutions after Oct. 7, 2023, is also very, very low). The only advantage that Netanyahu could see now is that it took some of the attention off the hostage issue. He is struggling between the pressure of the families and the public, which support a deal even at the cost of a total cease-fire, and the [Israeli government] coalition. The ultra-right parties of this coalition say, \u201cif you surrender to Hamas\u2019s demands, we will disassemble the coalition.\u201d RA: Suzanne, how is Iran thinking about all of these proxy groups that it funds in the region, the so-called axis of resistance? SM: For a regime whose primary goal is simply to stay in power, this is a very dangerous and unpredictable moment for them. They\u2019ve survived an awful lot over the course of the past 45 years\u2014internal terrorism, external invasion, earthquakes, drought, pandemic. In terms of what this moment means for the proxies, Lebanon-based Hezbollah is the most valuable asset that Iran has. Obviously, the Israelis have been hitting back at Hezbollah throughout the course of the Gaza war. And even before that, Hezbollah has been a significant concern to the Israelis because of its massive arsenal of very advanced and precision-guided missiles. And so, Hezbollah is the jewel in the crown for the Iranians. It will be critical to Iran\u2019s ability to coordinate and deploy these other militias. I think what happens to Hezbollah is the other big concern for Iran and its future strategy. RA: Ronen, it was striking to me that the United States shot down more Iranian drones and missiles than Israel itself. And that\u2019s despite the fact that the so-called ironclad alliance between Israel and the United States has been strained in recent months. Add to that fact, the Arab and Gulf countries that also came to Israel\u2019s assistance\u2014notably including Jordan, which has been increasingly critical of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. Do any of these countries have more leverage to push Israel to change its strategy at all? RB: The last few months have shown us that the organ of gratitude does not exist for the Netanyahu regime. The prime minister is continuing his policy that basically cherishes the integrity of the [domestic] coalition above everything else. Even when the Israeli military is so dependent on the continuous flow of munition, and Iron Dome interceptors, etc. Even as U.S. President Joe Biden stood so firmly with Israel after Oct. 7 and is risking his political career because of Israel, losing support from some of his base. The government and the prime minister feel that it will serve their popularity to keep in the coalition together, so they have no problem with publicly fighting with the U.S. president. And this doesn\u2019t make any sense unless you understand that the integrity of the coalition, the continuation of the war at a lower intensity, and doing everything possible to stop the public from going into the streets to demand an inquiry, an investigation, and new elections. And so this is the only thing. It is the dominant reason why Israel did not yet sign the hostage deal. This explains everything. This goes back to your question. Because it feels such gratitude to the Americans, the defense establishment is now very keen on not doing anything without fully coordinating, or at least not totally objected to, by the United States. According to multiple sources, it seems that the United States has said \u201cwe will not support you if you go strike Iran. But if the strike is containable, if there\u2019s a chance that Iran would not react. Then we will continue to defend you in case it does.\u201d We are talking about two enemies that don\u2019t want an all-out war. We also see this with Israel vis-a-vis Hezbollah throughout the last six months. Israel wants to make sure it is not risking war, so what they do is very limited. What Iran did was an enormous risk. I know a lot of people in Israeli intelligence are looking at Iran\u2019s thinking, wondering what the supreme leader\u2019s new mindset is. Even with the need to make a point, and get revenge, and respond to demands from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, why did the supreme leader take such a risk? My speculation is that he saw Israel at its weakest. Just like [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar making the call back in October to strike Israel, because he saw weakness. The supreme leader saw the immense international pressure that Israel is under, that the operation in Gaza is going nowhere, and he saw the rift between Netanyahu and Biden. And he said, now is our time to do something. RA: Suzanne, assuming that Israel\u2019s status quo will not improve much in the next six months, how will this Israeli weakness guide Tehran\u2019s reactions and its use of proxies? SM: The explanation that Ronen is just offered is completely consistent with how Iran has approached the war. And even before the war. The supreme leader gave a speech in early October in which he used very traditional rhetoric about Israel passing from the passage of time or whatever the proper translation of the Persian expression is. But what you see from that speech is that he predicts that Israel will die of rage. Since the revolution itself, the Islamic Republic has not been particularly interested in going to war with Israel for a variety of reasons, including the expectation that it might not win. But also, the presumption has always been that Israel was going to just simply collapse or erode. They\u2014and I\u2019m sure as Ronen said, Sinwar\u2014interpreted the intense divisions within Israeli society and Israeli politics over the past year or so as a huge opportunity. The same way that they looked at the Trump period in the United States as evidence of polarization, as a weakening corrosion of society and politics. This is part of why we\u2019re seeing more assertive action from the Iranians. They think that there\u2019s an opportunity here. They want to make the most of it. And their best levers to do so have always been using the various proxies to try to apply as much pressure as possible, and to try to ensure that Israel shrinks within its own borders, that Israel is delegitimized around the world, and that the political divisions within Israel, as well as the economic cost of the conflict, contribute to this long-term process of the failing of the Israeli enterprise. That\u2019s what they believe about Israel. It\u2019s what they believe about the United States, for that matter. RA: Ronen, if you look at Oct. 7 as the start of this phase of the war, what happens next in Gaza? Given everything you\u2019re saying about Israel\u2019s moment of weakness, and given everything you\u2019ve described about Netanyahu\u2019s incentives. RB: I think that there are basically two options. And I know it\u2019s very risky to say something like that about the Middle East, especially this time. I think that now, either Israel is forced in few months to evacuate. And again, Israel is not fighting a war, but a very limited military incursion in Gaza since mid- to early-January. This is not to say anything about the unbelievable suffering of the refugees, the hunger, the people dying. The idea of a cease-fire is by itself a vote of disconfidence in the ability to achieve the targets of the war. So either Israel is forced to withdraw by the United States and the international community and internal pressure that no longer believes in this war. Or Israel agrees to a discussion to the so-called \u201cday after\u201d that allows the Palestinian Authority to take control with the help of the Gulf states and the United States with some kind of reform. That would also be as part of a full hostage deal for Palestinian inmates that would also give Hamas the release of some very famous inmates and a total cease-fire. This is, of course, preferable. It will enable Israel to reap the fruits of the limited success of the military. But I think that Netanyahu will do everything he can to stop it, because this will be the end of his coalition. He\u2019s trying to maintain some kind of leverage to Hamas instead of allowing the Palestinian Authority in, because he will be forced to discuss a two-state solution and lose his base. So again, we go back to his coalition.",

                    "post_content": "The Iranian attack on Israel over the weekend is likely to complicate efforts by progressives in Washington to condition certain types of military aid to Israel over the spiraling humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Gaza.\u00a0 In a letter sent on Sunday night, more than 100 Republicans and Democrats urged Mike Johnson, the speaker of the U.S.House of Representatives, to hold a vote on a multibillion-dollar military aid package for Israel as soon as Monday evening.\u00a0 The $95 billion dollar bill, which also includes military aid for Ukraine as well as Taiwan, was passed by the Senate in February and contains $14 billion in security assistance for Israel. It has since stalled in the House over Republican reservations about providing further military aid to Ukraine.\u00a0 Overnight on Saturday, Tehran launched a volley of more than 300 drones and missiles in an unprecedented attack on Israel, which came in response to an Israeli airstrike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, at the beginning of April, which killed seven senior commanders of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\u00a0 Israeli officials said that 99 percent of the drones and missiles launched from Iran were successfully intercepted, with an injured 7-year-old girl being the only known casualty.\u00a0 After decades of shadow war across the Middle East and beyond, the attack marks the first time that Tehran has struck Israel directly and risks pushing an already volatile region to the brink.\u00a0 Amid a nesting doll of regional wars, Iran\u2019s attack underscored the grave threats to Israel\u2019s security even as it wages its own unsparing war in Gaza, and it will complicate\u2014if perhaps only temporarily\u2014the political calculus for those looking to curtail U.S. military aid to Israel.\u00a0 Before Saturday\u2019s attack, a growing chorus of Democrats and progressives in Washington were calling for the Biden administration to subject U.S. security assistance to greater scrutiny in the wake of an Israeli strike on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy that killed seven humanitarian aid workers.\u00a0 In the wake of the strike, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has a long record of strongly supporting Israel, joined 39 Democratic lawmakers in signing a letter to the Biden administration calling for arms transfers to Israel to be withheld until a full investigation is conducted. The letter also described the recent U.S. transfer to Israel of 2,000-lb. bombs, which are capable of destroying a whole city block, as \u201cunjustifiable\u201d in light of the \u201c\u200b\u200bever-worsening humanitarian crisis.\u201d\u00a0 Pelosi\u2014along with two other House Democrats who joined the letter calling for a rethink of U.S. military aid to Israel, Reps. Sara Jacobs and Jahana Hayes\u2014also signed Sunday\u2019s missive to Speaker Mike Johnson calling for a vote on the multibillion-dollar supplemental aid package to Israel.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Pelosi described the former speaker\u2019s position as \u201cfully consistent,\u201d adding, \u201cShe signed the April 5 letter to call for a pause on offensive weapons transfers until there was an independent investigation into the attack on the World Central Kitchen heroes, steps the Administration has taken and is taking. So it\u2019s fully compatible with the April 14 letter urging the House to take up and pass the Senate supplemental.\u201d Spokespeople for Jacobs and Hayes did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Calls to condition military aid to Israel may only be temporarily dampened, said Matt Duss, a former foreign-policy advisor to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders who now leads the Center for International Policy, a progressive think tank in Washington.\u00a0 \u201cThis is a position that has been gaining support in the party for a long time, one now supported by a majority of Democratic voters,\u201d he said in a message to Foreign Policy. \u201cThe Gaza catastrophe has made it more salient, but it\u2019s not just about Gaza, it\u2019s about whether we\u2019re actually going to enforce our own laws governing military aid.\u201d Israel\u2019s strike on the World Central Kitchen convoy, which an Israel Defense Forces investigation found to be a \u201cserious violation\u201d of its procedures, appeared to be a tipping point for U.S. President Joe Biden, who, in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a few days after the strike, said that his administration\u2019s policy going forward would be determined by Israel\u2019s efforts to mitigate civilian harm and humanitarian suffering. Yet administration officials have not publicly outlined how their policy might change should Israel fail to satisfy U.S. demands\u2014a fact that seems to be causing frustration among some Democrats.\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any more definition as to what policy changes would be made,\u201d Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, who has been increasingly outspoken about the need to condition the sale of offensive weapons to Israel, said last week before the Iranian attack occurred. Regarded by Washington as a highly strategic democratic partner in the Middle East, Israel has been the No. 1 recipient of U.S. security assistance since World War II. The majority of the military aid provided to Israel each year is foreign military financing to the tune of $3.3 billion, under a 10-year memorandum of understanding\u2014the third of its kind\u2014that the Obama administration signed in 2016. A further $500 million is allocated to funding Israel\u2019s multilayered missile defense programs, such as the Iron Dome and Arrow, which were integral in fending off the onslaught of Iranian missiles and drones over the weekend.\u00a0 While there have been increasing calls to condition the transfer of offensive weapons to Israel, support for missile defense remains widespread, as the country has faced continual rocket attacks from Hezbollah in Lebanon since the Hamas attack that started the current war on Oct. 7, 2023. \u201cPolitically, Iron Dome funding is never going to be on the table, and I understand that\u2014that is a very popular provision,\u201d said Ari Tolany, the director of the Security Assistance Monitor at the Center for International Policy.\u00a0 Biden, a longtime staunch supporter of Israel, is unlikely to put any significant restrictions on security assistance to the country, reiterating his \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to its security in light of the attacks by Iran.\u00a0 But those advocating for the administration to bring greater pressure to bear on the Israeli government point to a number of steps that the administration could take to help curb the toll exacted on civilians in Gaza without undermining Israel\u2019s defensive capabilities. One is to use the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act, which calls on the president to halt arms sales to a country known to be holding up U.S. humanitarian assistance. \u201cIt does seem that the Netanyahu government has been in violation of the terms of the humanitarian aid corridors act,\u201d said Van Hollen, who said the State Department\u2019s reasoning for not invoking the act in briefings to senators was \u201ccompletely unsatisfactory\u201d and based on a \u201ccramped\u201d reading of the law.\u00a0 Presidents can override the law if they find a pressing need to continue to supply military aid, as then-President Bill Clinton did in the 1990s when he waived restrictions on Turkey despite that country\u2019s obstruction of humanitarian aid to Armenia. Doing so allows the president to publicly call out aid obstructions while maintaining weapons supplies.\u00a0 Continuing to supply Israel with military aid while it throttles humanitarian assistance into Gaza without invoking the act at all \u201csends a clear political signal that Israel\u2019s conduct in both Gaza and the West Bank is not a red line,\u201d Tolany said.\u00a0 Another step that the administration could take would be to limit the transfer of certain offensive munitions to Israel, such as the 2,000-lb. so-called \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs, hundreds of which have been used in Gaza. \u201cIf we stop replacing them for a time, with the understanding that if a war broke out with Hezbollah things could change, the Israeli targeting decisions would change,\u201d said a Senate aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.\u00a0 Though U.S. law includes extensive provisions to pause military aid to a country or military unit on humanitarian and human rights grounds, it offers significant latitude to the executive branch, said the Senate aide. For arms transfers worth more than $25 million, the administration must formally notify Congress of the sale\u2014although the administration has approved more than 100 separate sales of lethal aid in packages that fall below the threshold required to notify lawmakers.\u00a0 An informal notification process ahead of an arms transfer is intended to give the four leaders of the House and Senate foreign relations committees the opportunity to quietly raise any concerns about the deal\u2014without their objections spilling into the public eye.\u00a0 Lawmakers have used this process as an opportunity to extract concessions or secure greater oversight, Tolany said. This can significantly delay but not scupper a deal entirely. To fully block an arms transfer, it would require a resolution of disapproval passed by the House and Senate and a supermajority of support to override a likely presidential veto\u2014something that no Congress has ever managed to do for an military aid arms transfer. \u201cIt takes just a huge amount for Congress to overrule the president\u2019s will,\u201d the Senate aide said.\u00a0 \u00a0 There is precedent for a U.S. president to withhold military aid to Israel. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan placed a temporary hold on the export of F-16 fighter jets and cluster munitions to Israel over its conduct during the war in Lebanon. In 1991, Secretary of State James Baker threatened to withhold $10 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to help Israel resettle Jews from the former Soviet Union if it continued to build settlements in the occupied territories.\u00a0 And last year, the Biden administration blocked the transfer of almost 30,000 rifles intended for use by the Israeli police over concerns that they could fall into the hands of extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank. Critics have argued that Israel is not held to the same standard as other countries when it comes to scrutinizing the involvement of U.S. military aid in human rights abuses. For most recipients of U.S. security assistance, military or security service units that receive the aid are screened in a process known as Leahy vetting and prohibited from receiving U.S. support if there is \u201ccredible information\u201d they have been involved in human rights abuses.\u00a0 For countries that receive significant amounts of aid\u2014Ukraine, Israel, and Egypt\u2014the secretary of state provides the countries with lists of military units that are prohibited from receiving the aid, while an internal State Department forum monitors for any allegations of human rights violations. Since 2020, more than a dozen incidents of alleged abuses by Israeli forces have been reviewed by the State Department, according to the Guardian, but none have been upheld.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s not that the laws aren\u2019t there, it\u2019s just that there is no willingness to enforce them,\u201d said Josh Paul, a former senior State Department official who resigned from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs in late October over U.S. military assistance to Israel.\u00a0",

                    "post_content": "Growing numbers of progressive U.S. leaders are calling for a different White House policy on Israel. The latest is Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, who described Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as an obstacle to peace. (Netanyahu responded on CNN by calling Schumer\u2019s comments \u201ctotally inappropriate.\u201d) Richard Haass has long been seen as a bellwether in the U.S. foreign-policy commentariat. A former head of the State Department\u2019s policy planning team, Haass ran the Council on Foreign Relations for more than 20 years before stepping down last year. I spoke to him on FP Live, the magazine\u2019s forum for live journalism. What follows is an edited and condensed transcript. Ravi Agrawal: Let\u2019s start with the Middle East. You wrote in the Wall Street Journal last week that after Oct. 7, 2023, almost all of Israel\u2019s choices have been counterproductive. How so? Richard Haass: Well, I thought that Israel had to respond. It was a war of necessity for Israel to respond, but there was a wide range of possibilities as to what it actually did\u2014for example, its use of military force. It could have been much more targeted with small units rather than various types of aerial and bulk bombardment, which was sure to cause large numbers of civilian casualties. Israel could have been much more forthcoming on opening up land routes for humanitarian assistance. Above all, Israel could have introduced a significant political track. The parallel here I have from my time as the U.S. envoy in Northern Ireland, and what the British did in Northern Ireland is they introduced a significant police and military presence during the three decades of the Troubles, from the late 1960s to the late 1990s. But they also opened up a political track. And what they essentially told the Provisional IRA (Irish Republican Army) and other paramilitaries is, \u201clook, you will never shoot your way to power. But if you give up arms, you hand them over and you enter the political track, you may not get everything you want, but you will get some of what you want. And you will get a lot more than you would ever get by using force.\u201d That has been almost entirely missing from Israeli policy. RA: And you listed out some steps that Israel could take going forward. What are they? RH: Well, among other things, I would want to see the Israelis be much more measured in their use of military force. Open up more land roads to allow aid in. On the political side, to start the conversation to say, \u201clook, we\u2019re potentially open to realizing some Palestinian political ambitions, and even conceivably down the road, a separate state. But here are some of the conditions you\u2019ve got to meet. It\u2019s got to be a demilitarized state. You\u2019ve got to rule out the use of political violence.\u201d The Israelis also have to show their bona fides here. I would say to rein in certainly not just settler violence, but new settlements. Territory is a critical dimension of any political conversation or negotiation you\u2019re going to have. Obviously, this Israeli government is unwilling to do that. What I\u2019ve been arguing is that the United States needs to present these choices to the Israeli body politic. I get that after Oct. 7, it\u2019s psychologically, emotionally, extraordinarily difficult. We\u2019ve got to be very careful about how we do this. Israel is an entire society, essentially with PTSD, for so many good reasons. But we have to help the Israelis begin to make the transition from what I would call the world of Oct. 7 to the world of Oct. 8. RA: You\u2019re an influential voice in U.S. policymaking. And for a while now, you\u2019ve been saying that President Joe Biden should go to the Knesset and speak directly to the Israeli people about his disagreements with their prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. How is that proposal being received by the Biden administration? RH: I think the idea of going to the Knesset is probably not going to happen. I like the idea\u2014the symbolism of it. I\u2019ll be honest with you: Part of it was, \u201cwhat\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.\u201d After Netanyahu came here on the floor of the Congress and essentially talked against the Iran nuclear deal, I like the idea of a president of the United States going to the Knesset to go over the head of the prime minister and this government. A lot of people who know Israel well said that\u2019s probably a mistake. You could end up with a lot of heckling. I actually thought that would be an opportunity for the president. Imagine the following scenario, where Joe Biden was on the floor of the Knesset, and some people started heckling, and he said, \u201cShame on you. I represent the United States of America. Over the decades, we have been Israel\u2019s most stalwart friend. We have provided this much economic aid, this much military. We have vetoed resolutions against you. However many times, we are there with you. And just because we disagree with you on a matter of policy doesn\u2019t mean that we are not with you or for you.\u201d I would have welcomed that. My sense is it might be too risky for the administration. So, I think the real question is how the president builds on what he began to say in the State of the Union. I think the Biden\u2019s posture so far has been that of a disappointed uncle, along the lines of this: \u201cI really care for you, Israel, but I think you\u2019re making some mistakes. I think some of what you\u2019re doing is counterproductive.\u201d The president, though, has been somewhat reluctant to go much, much further than, that. And he needs to\u2014both with words and also with policies. RA: Building on that, Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, gave a speech last week that in many ways is seen as a watershed of sorts. This is the highest-ranking Jewish American elected official in the U.S. government, a stalwart backer of Israel for decades. And he made an appeal to the Israeli people to look beyond Netanyahu. I imagine that appeal took a lot of courage. Will it change anything? RH: It did take a lot of courage, and I think the Israelis will dismiss it at their peril. The fact that Schumer\u2014given his history, given who he is, given his generation\u2014would say those things, is, to me, quite telling. But I think he made a mistake by making it so much about Netanyahu. Ad hominem is never a good idea. I think he made a mistake by advising Israel to have new elections. I never get comfortable when we get inside the political processes of others. What Biden ought to be doing is just focusing on the policy. Just say where you disagree and why and what it is you\u2019d like to see and why. Explain. Educate. Do it with sympathy. But stay away from the personality because, quite honestly, this transcends Netanyahu. Our attacking him, for all I know, could help him politically. He could stand up and say, \u201cI\u2019m the only person in Israel who\u2019s strong enough. You may not like me, but I can push back against the United States.\u201d And look at the demographic changes in Israel. Look at the political shifts in Israel over recent decades. There\u2019s really not a left anymore. So you could technically get rid of Netanyahu, and you may not get something qualitatively different. So I would couch it in policy terms, not in personal terms. RA: There\u2019s one part of Schumer\u2019s speech, that I think isn\u2019t getting enough attention. He referenced Israel testing \u201cexisting U.S. standards\u201d for assistance. I think that could have been a reference to the so-called Leahy Law, which says the White House can\u2019t give military aid to countries that commit gross human rights violations. How significant was that? RH: If the Israelis go ahead with their assault into Rafah and there are large numbers of civilian casualties, I think you will see something like that\u2014that we won\u2019t deny certain types of arms, but say something like, \u201cyou can\u2019t use them in these ways.\u201d For example, large, several-thousand-pound bombs. Or we may prioritize providing Israel with targeted munitions, which, by definition, are much less likely to cause certain types of collateral damage. I think there could be pressure on Israel if it interferes with aid deliveries. So yes, I think what we\u2019re moving toward is a more conditional relationship rather than a blank check. RA: In my introduction, I said we\u2019d discuss how public pressure can maybe shift foreign policy along the margins. We\u2019ve been talking a lot about what should happen, or what leaders and policymakers are proposing, but how much does polling matter? So, for example, U.S. views of Israel are at their lowest point in about 20 years. Is that playing a significant role in this shift in rhetoric that we\u2019re seeing? RH: People are genuinely moved by what they see. Radical notion: Policies are made by policymakers, and policymakers are people, too. So, it\u2019s not just people putting their finger in the wind and saying, \u201cwhich way are the polls going?\u201d When I think about this election, even people like you and me, we spend our time debating Ukraine or debating Taiwan or so forth. I don\u2019t see those issues showing up much in political behavior. The most recent Gallup poll said only 3 percent of Americans cited foreign policy as the issue that they thought was salient for most Americans. It\u2019s one of the ironies of this campaign. Foreign policy will barely figure in the campaign, and the consequences of the campaign for foreign policy are enormous. And it\u2019s another disconnect, if you will, between what\u2019s happening in this country and the rest of the world.

                    "post_content": "Last month, we visited elected and military leaders in the Middle East and Ukraine, two seemingly unrelated regions linked by a similar threat: a malign and destructive force that gravely endangers national security as well as regional stability. In both regions, U.S. commitment and engagement are indispensable to preserving democracies and ending lethal armed conflict. In both, failing to do so will have decadeslong destructive consequences\u2014not just for Washington\u2019s standing around the globe, but also for U.S. interests and even American lives in these regions. During our meetings, heads of government, military commanders, humanitarian agencies, and our own diplomats and soldiers in Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Oman, and Ukraine all delivered dire warnings. Innocent civilians in Gaza have no place left to run, no food to eat. Ukrainian troops are rationing ammunition on the front lines and losing territory to the Russians. We witnessed this in Lebanon, where we saw burned shops and barricades from when an angry mob tried to storm our embassy and were held back by the Lebanese Armed Forces, who have benefited from years of U.S. training and support. In Jordan, we met with the American and Jordanian military leaders who were the first on the ground to respond to the terrible attack on Tower 22 that cost three U.S. soldiers their lives. In Ukraine, as in the Middle East, the United States remains an essential partner. Ukrainian troops are dying and losing ground because they lack the basic equipment they need to continue their fight. A global coalition of more than 50 nations has already contributed more to the Ukrainian war effort than the United States, often at much higher percentages of their respective defense budgets or GDP. The European Union remains committed to Ukraine\u2019s fight, recently passing a $54 billion aid deal for Ukraine. It is with U.S. military support, however, that Ukraine can not only fight back, but can win. Without it, Ukraine is much more likely to fail\u2014and sooner than many may think. Once Ukraine falls, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s next attack will likely be against a NATO ally, compelling us to come to their defense and inevitably putting our own troops on the front lines. Our troops may be equally at risk if the situation in Gaza worsens and conflict spreads throughout the region. In our conversations in Jordan and Lebanon, we heard how explosive just one miscalculation could be. Along the border between Israel and Lebanon, we heard about the tens of thousands of innocent people who have been displaced by attacks on both sides. In Jordan, we saw how cheap but deadly drones are effectively defying the advanced systems meant to counter them. Iranian proxies\u2014such as the Yemen-based Houthis, Lebanon-based Hezbollah, and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq\u2014are seeking to capitalize on the growing anti-Americanism and achieve Iran\u2019s long-desired goal of forcing the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the region. Our diplomatic and military personnel are already under attack by these proxies in Iraq\u2014a threat made very real to us by being woken up in Baghdad to the sound of anti-drone ammunition rounds. We cannot afford to let Iran succeed; otherwise, the United States will face a very real prospect of war. While anti-American rhetoric might sharpen due to increased U.S. involvement in the region, disengagement leaves countries in the region with even fewer options and no choice but to embrace malign influences, such as Iran. We cannot hope to change minds or build relationships if we back away. Ultimately, preventing a wider war in the Middle East will require delivering a message demonstrating that Washington recognizes Israel\u2019s obligation to defend itself, but also expects that Israel upholds international humanitarian and human rights law and that its military operations meet the highest standards. For example, the national security memorandum that U.S. President Joe Biden released last month, which requires allies receiving military aid to provide assurances to the United States that their actions are compliant with international law, was able to send a strong message to Israel\u2014and the region as a whole. While we recognize Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, the war to dismantle Hamas must also seek to minimize devastating harm to innocent civilians. To show that it\u2019s serious about protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza, Israel should open additional border crossings and improve deconfliction mechanisms to increase humanitarian assistance. Regardless, the United States isn\u2019t waiting to deliver aid. Biden has listened to the large group of senators who have called for the United States to directly deliver urgent, critically needed humanitarian aid to Gaza, by air and sea, much like the Jordanian and French governments have successfully done. The United States has started air dropping ready-to-eat meals from cargo planes and plans to construct a temporary port off the Gazan coast to facilitate an even greater movement of food aid to civilians. In our meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we warned against a large-scale ground offensive in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza without appropriate evacuation plans and measures in place to mitigate civilian casualties. The United States is the only nation that has the credibility to send this message to Israel. If Netanyahu fails to listen, the Biden administration and Congress will be prepared to take more persuasive steps to ensure compliance with U.S. policy on civilian protection and humanitarian assistance. However difficult, we need to hold even our closest allies accountable. We have real hope that a meaningful humanitarian pause in the fighting in Gaza, combined with a hostage release, is within reach. There are still gulfs, but they\u2019re bridgeable\u2014thanks largely to the efforts of the Biden administration to mediate an agreement between Israel and Hamas, with Qatar and Egypt acting as intermediaries. A longer humanitarian pause could even reopen the door to greater possibilities for peace in the Middle East through Israel-Saudi normalization and economic integration. Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords as the sixth signatory would be a game-changer in the region, spurring other Arab states to follow its lead. It would strengthen regional security and economic ties against Iran\u2019s malign influence. Understanding that, Hamas and its backers in Iran carried out its atrocious attack on Oct. 7, 2023, partly to prevent a realignment between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The best way that we can counter Iran and defeat Hamas would be to return to these discussions and find a path forward toward normalization, which will only happen with active partnership by the United States. We were close to an agreement prior to the Oct. 7 attacks; a pause in fighting could get us to conditions where constructive dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Israel can happen again. At every stop on our trip, we heard that the solution to building greater security and a potential path toward peace is more U.S. engagement, not less. Our colleagues in the House of Representatives who tend toward an uninvolved, isolationist approach need to hear that, and they must help us meet that challenge by promptly passing the national security supplemental. We can set the Israel-Hamas war on a path to peace by making it clear to the Israelis what we expect from them in the region and taking steps to ensure a real Palestinian future. We can give Ukraine the support it needs to defeat the brutal Russian invasion. That might seem like a tall order, but none of it comes together without the United States leading the way.",

                    "post_content": "All roads seem to lead to Iran right now. The White House attributes last weekend\u2019s attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan to the Islamic Resistance in Iraq\u2014a coalition of militias said to be backed by Tehran. Iran also is known to support Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, both of whom have played a role in worsening the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. And, of course, Iran backs Hamas, which started the latest round of fighting with its attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. The White House has already said it will retaliate against Iran\u2014or its proxies\u2014for causing the first U.S. deaths under fire since Oct. 7. But how? As Republican lawmakers put pressure on President Joe Biden to attack Tehran directly, what do we know of Iran\u2019s real relations with a hazy network of militias across the Middle East, and how might an American response lead in turn to further counterattacks? To answer some of these questions, I spoke with two experts on Iran and the Middle East: Vali Nasr, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who has advised several U.S. administrations on the Middle East, and Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. The interview was conducted on FP Live. Subscribers can watch a video in the box atop this page. What follows is a condensed and edited transcript. Ravi Agrawal: Let\u2019s discuss the attack on U.S. soldiers. What is the Islamic Resistance in Iraq? How are they connected to Iran? Sanam Vakil: The Islamic group behind the attack on U.S. soldiers came together as part of a vanguard group of forces inside Iraq. They are part of an axis of resistance. Inside Iraq, there are a variety of militias or nonstate hybrid actors, some that are part of the political establishment and elected into government, and some that aren\u2019t. The coalition isn\u2019t directly connected to Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani\u2019s government, but the network is large and broad. This group has been very active since the Gaza war began, using pressure and escalation, particularly against the United States, to press for a cease-fire in Gaza. And this has broadly been the axis of resistance\u2019s strategy. The axis operates uniquely because they\u2019re in multiple countries, but the domestic dynamics of each country don\u2019t always result in their responding in the same way. RA: Vali, Sanam mentioned an \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d You\u2019ve just written an essay about exactly that. Can you describe why this axis matters? Vali Nasr: The term \u201caxis of resistance\u201d has been used recently by Iran and Hezbollah to describe a loose network of militias, organizations, and political forces [Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Islamic Resistance in Iraq]\u2014it even includes the Assad regime in Damascus\u2014who share a strategic view that their interests lie in challenging the United States-backed order, U.S. allies like the Gulf countries and Israel. They\u2019re bound together by the command-and-control structure that Iran\u2019s [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] IRGC Quds Force has put together, but there is also a significant amount of domestic interests as well. For instance, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq is itself a loose network of a variety of militias. Some are closer to Iran, some are not. Some have been integrated into Iraqi security forces. Some are outside of it. Generally, it represents a side of Iraqi politics. They\u2019re not Iranians and they\u2019re not Iran-controlled robots, either. Increasingly, they rely on financial capabilities that are raised domestically within Iraq through thuggery, mafia and criminal activities, and extortion. This is an unintended consequence of America\u2019s so-called maximum pressure sanctions on Iran. But just because Iran can\u2019t pay them doesn\u2019t mean they go away. They\u2019ve been becoming more financially independent from Iran. They now also have a stake in the Iraqi state. They have become the representatives of anti-Americanism in Iraq, especially since the United States assassinated their main leader, along with Iranian Gen. Qassem Suleimani four years ago. Part of their political agenda, and the way they have tried to get a greater foothold in Iraqi politics, is to be able to pressure the government and ask U.S. forces to leave. Every counterstrike accentuates this. Tehran has broad strategic control over them. It does supply them with knowhow, information, intelligence, and weaponry, and also technology transfers so that they can build their own cheap drones using missiles, but it is not correct to use the term Iran-backed, assuming that they\u2019re completely driven by what Tehran wants. They have independent sets of interests. RA: Sanam, whether we call them Iran-backed or proxies or increasingly independent, one thing strikes me as strange: Tehran seems to draw on them and yet gains advantage from a form of plausible deniability. But now that some U.S. policymakers are, rightly or wrongly, talking about directly attacking Iran, it also seems like a very thin deniability for Tehran. So how does Tehran think about these associations? SV: This is the first time we\u2019re seeing the axis of resistance work together so openly in a coordinated manner. Tehran has been working toward this over a number of years. Vali mentioned that in 2020, the United States killed Suleimani, who was the visionary bringing these groups together. He also had deep and personal connections and investments with individuals across this network. He had much more of a command-and-control structure for the organization. In that drone killing, they also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was instrumental in managing the Iraqi groups. Since their death, Iran has appointed a new commander named Esmail\u00a0Qaani, and the management of the axis of resistance has somewhat changed. There\u2019s been a lot of whispering that perhaps Qaani was weak or couldn\u2019t manage these groups in the same way. What we\u2019ve been witnessing for the past few years is a transition from a much more centralized system to a decentralized system, and this has led to greater autonomy and agency of these groups. Iran is the backer, the patron, and the visionary of this system. Within the security-minded establishment in Iran that retains authority over this strategy, known as forward defense for the way it creates deterrence for Iran, pushing Iran\u2019s perceived threats away from its borders and into territories where it can exert influence. The feeling is that this strategy has borne fruit for Tehran, and it\u2019s protected Iran. If you look at the positioning of these groups, the axis of resistance sits on all of Israel\u2019s borders and is deeply embedded in a number of countries and political systems across the Middle East, from Syria to Lebanon to Iraq, and with the Houthis in Yemen, they have become a political force, whether we like it or not. They\u2019ve been disrupting maritime shipping. They\u2019re now a strategic force to be reckoned with. There are certainly weaknesses that Iran is absorbing and strategic and tactical adjustments that will take place in the coming years. But this group has developed, and it\u2019s going to be much harder to unravel, and that\u2019s a problem for the international community and the United States. RA: But what is the throughline in terms of what these groups want? Vali, you\u2019ve argued in the past that there\u2019s a broader anti-colonial sentiment among these groups, sometimes aimed at Israel, and the United States as well. Can you explain where that comes from? VN: The idea of anti-imperialism was part and parcel of the Iranian revolution since 1979. It came with Ayatollah [Ruhollah] Khomeini. He wanted the United States out of Iran and the Middle East. His view was that the United States was an imperialist power and that it was supporting Israel, which was also functioning in the same way in the region. That anti-Americanism and the foundations of it is really an anti-colonial argument. Whether you like that argument or not, it is now baked into the ideology of the Islamic Republic. These groups that the Islamic Republic has given rise to over time, like the Houthis or Hezbollah, are also basically feeding on the same set of ideas. As they appear on the United States\u2019 radar and the United States hits them by either designating them as terrorists, imposing sanctions on them, or militarily hitting them, decapitating members, the anti-Americanism becomes much more immediate and urgent. It\u2019s no longer theoretical. The Iraqi militias were not sophisticated enough in 2022 to espouse a very clear anti-American ideology. But after increasingly direct confrontations with the United States, this has now become absorbed in the way in which they talk about Iraqi politics. They are foisting a radical Iraqi nationalism, which demands the United States leave Iraq because the United States is a colonial force. There is a much more complex set of issues behind this. What\u2019s happening in Gaza and Israel\u2019s rhetoric is seen as an existential threat to Hezbollah. Hezbollah has much more skin in the game right now than does Iran. And therefore, its reactions to Israeli bombardment, to whether Israel can roll over Hamas overnight and then turn its attention north, to Israeli demands that Hezbollah evacuates southern Lebanon\u2014it\u2019s not directed from Tehran. Hezbollah itself believes that if it wasn\u2019t for their resistance, that Israel would have settlements in southern Lebanon right now. This ideology is now baked in. It brings all of these groups and Iran together because they share a worldview that there is an order in the Middle East sustained by the United States, which has imperialist ambitions, that Israel is its agent and this order tries to exclude them, eliminate them, and they represent some form of nativist nationalism against imperialism. Even though we think that the fight against imperialism died long ago in most of the world, it still very much resonates in the Middle East. In the Gaza war, they have found new life, because within the region, the Gaza war is seen in terms of Israel\u2019s settlements and in terms of Palestinian resistance. They view themselves in a grand war with the United States and with Israel, and therefore their decisions are based on whether they preempt or deter or they try to rally the region around the fact that they are carrying the torch of anti-imperialism against the United States. RA: Circling back to last weekend\u2019s attack, what are the options that the White House is considering in response? Do you get the sense that there is a deeper understanding of the broader trends that you\u2019ve been describing, about anti-U.S. and anti-colonial sentiments? VN: The White House and European governments have to understand that the mood in the Middle East is not sympathetic to Israel and is not sympathetic to the United States, and that it would not serve Western interests to get deep into a much larger war in the Middle East. Not only because it\u2019s an election year and the American people don\u2019t want another war, but also because the United States would be doing so at a time which would be very difficult to rally support for it, even if three American soldiers have been killed. The dominant theme in the region is not Iranian or Islamic extremism; it is what\u2019s happening in Gaza. Those images dominate. The United States has said repeatedly that it does not want a larger war, that when it reacts to the axis of resistance it is trying to deter. The president must decide what the American objective is when he chooses a target. Is the American objective retribution and restoring deterrence, or to take the war to Iran, which is what a lot of Republicans are encouraging? That essentially means a much larger war. There is no way in which you could do that without risking a larger war. My sense is that the president will not go for expanding the war. He will go for retribution and deterrence. That means choosing a significant target, hitting it hard, showing American power, but being very careful not to invite a retaliation at this point in time and hoping that everybody cools off and that you don\u2019t put the opposite side in a position that they have to go big for their own reasons, which will get us into an unwanted escalatory cycle and into a direct war. RA: If America is thinking about attacking one of these proxies or Iran directly, as some Republicans have been saying very vocally, then who exactly is America dealing with? Iran\u2019s leadership have council elections coming up in March. There have been rumors about the ayatollah\u2019s health. What is your sense of the stability of the power centers in Tehran and how that might be shaping policy choices? VN: As long as the supreme leader in Iran is alive and is functioning, the current situation is fairly stable. There were massive protests in Iran, led by young people, initially over the issue of freedom of dress for women over hijabs. But then it became something a lot bigger, and it rocked the regime. In the end, they weathered that storm, and that movement has dissipated for now. There\u2019s a lot of unhappiness in Iran, but there\u2019s no direct challenge to the established order in Iran. If the supreme leader becomes gravely ill or passes from the scene without a clear successor or somebody who can step into his shoes immediately, you\u2019re going to have much more diversity of opinion coming to the fore in Iran. Not only over whether or not we should support the axis of resistance, but how best can we support the axis of resistance? Just like in the United States, there\u2019s going to be different opinions about how to react to a certain incident in the region. There are hawkish Revolutionary Guard commanders who would want to launch all the missiles they have right now, and then there are more conservative ones who want to play the long game. And then there will be personal ambitions at play in the act because policy is also a pathway to political power. Right now, because of everything that\u2019s happening, the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guard has become an empire within the Revolutionary Guard, much larger and more prominent than other divisions. The division that manages the missiles has also become extremely prominent. Right now, the supreme leader is able to balance all of the ambitious activities and budgets of the various factions of the Revolutionary Guard, as well as the various factions within the broader political establishment. But if he were to pass from the scene, then Iran will be in a completely new place. He\u2019s been ruling Iran for close to four decades, and at the twilight of his rule, he\u2019s not about to change ideals. He\u2019s not about to come and say this whole strategy of building the axis of resistance was wrong. He is going to preserve his own legacy. He has a firm belief that what he\u2019s done is correct. He\u2019s very steadfast about the resistance anti-imperialist view. At the same time, much like Suleimani, he has personal relationships with people around the region. For instance, he and [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah have a very direct relationship. Nasrallah often doesn\u2019t bother necessarily going to Revolutionary Guard commanders when he wants something; he goes directly to the supreme leader. The supreme leader has an aura among the leadership of these groups that a new person would not have. Iran is in his succession mode. He may not be sick or passing from the scene right now, but both he and the system in Iran are now in a succession scenario. That is the context in which a lot of the decision-making is happening. RA: Sanam, I\u2019m curious for your thoughts on whether average Iranians buy into this broader anti-American, anti-Western narrative. Is that popular? How does that play into the fact that the West has sanctioned Iran for all these years and they have clearly had an economic impact? How does all of that interplay with the government\u2019s relationship with its people? SV: Iran is about to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the Iranian revolution. Every year that the government tries to bring people out in the streets and commemorate the survival of the Islamic Republic of Iran, it\u2019s harder and harder to do that. That\u2019s reflected not just in getting people out on the streets. It\u2019s reflected in the ballot box in every election cycle. There is lower turnout for a system that prided itself on having electoral legitimacy in the Middle East. When President [Ebrahim] Raisi was elected in 2021, he was elected around 45 percent turnout in a presidential election, which is an all-time low for Iran. As Iran goes into parliamentary elections, people in the country are telling me it\u2019s going to be very hard to rally people to come out to vote. There is a deep legitimacy crisis inside the Islamic Republic. People are despondent and deeply disappointed by the lack of governance, accountability, development, and economic growth for the Islamic Republic. I don\u2019t think that ordinary Iranians appreciate or celebrate Iran\u2019s ability to stand up to the West or the United States and Israel. What they have been saying for decades is stop investing in Gaza or Lebanon and give the resources back to Iran.",

                    "post_excerpt": "On the role of atrocities and their retelling in identitarian conflict.",
                    "post_content": "On the night of March 9-10, 1945, the United States dramatically shifted tactics late in its war with Japan. No longer would it place any emphasis on precision bombing of its enemy\u2019s territory. The new strategy that replaced this would intentionally be vastly more lethal. That evening, 334 U.S. aircraft flew in low over Tokyo, where they dropped an enormous quantity of incendiary bombs that destroyed 16 square miles in the heart of the capital. In this one assault, 1 million people were rendered homeless and as many as 100,000 Japanese people were killed. The United States knew exactly what it was doing. Afterward, its mastermind, Maj. Gen. Curtis LeMay (who would go on to advocate for Washington\u2019s enormous aerial bombing campaigns during the Vietnam War), stated that the citizens of Tokyo who lost their lives in incendiary raids had been \u201cscorched and boiled and baked to death.\u201d In moral terms, at least, LeMay wasn\u2019t the only high-ranking officer within the U.S. military to provide an assessment. Three months later, Brig. Gen. Bonner Fellers called the Tokyo air raids \u201cone of the most ruthless and barbaric killings of non-combatants in all history.\u201d I learned the details of this campaign as a correspondent in Japan in the early 2000s, where I developed a passion for the history of 20th-century Asia. As an American reporter, I felt compelled to wander the districts hardest hit by U.S. firebombs and write about an inadequately known event for a general readership. Later, I would do the same with the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the United States applied the same war strategy of indiscriminate attacks on civilian populations, only with even more ghastly and devastating weapons: newly invented atomic bombs. This story remains tremendously relevant to our world today. I would start with the fact that just seven years before it firebombed Tokyo, the United States voiced disbelief and outrage over imperial Japan\u2019s bombing of Chinese cities in its attempt to put down China\u2019s efforts to free itself from colonial rule. How can a nation travel so quickly from extreme condemnation of atrocities committed against civilians to commissioning similar atrocities itself, sometimes even accompanied by exultation? This question has long fascinated me. In the case of the United States\u2019 war against Japan, the deepest roots of the answer seem to lie in Japan\u2019s own atrocities. To be clear, what followed is no excuse. But Washington\u2019s almost exterminatory approach to the war found its public justification and incitement in the most notorious and even evil acts of Japan itself. As the eminent historian of Japan, John W. Dower, wrote in his pioneering work on World War II in Asia, War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War, U.S. righteousness in adopting these tactics drew upon the enemy\u2019s own history of morally indefensible atrocities. These ranged from the heavy shelling and bombing of Chinese cities, to a notorious contest by Japanese officers during the Nanjing Massacre to see who could be the first to kill 150 Chinese people with their samurai swords, to the death rate of Allied prisoners of war (which was nearly seven times higher when they were captured by Japan than by Germany or Italy), to, as Dower wrote, the \u201crape and murder of nuns in the streets of Hong Kong.\u201d Washington, in other words, made use of genuine Japanese monstrosities to justify and even amplify atrocities of its own. This awful past has resonated deeply with me for months as I have watched the unfolding of the conflict between Israel and Hamas and the outrageous toll that it has taken on civilians on both sides\u2014first against Israelis, and then in vastly larger numbers against Palestinians. Dower argues, I believe convincingly, that one only arrives at a state of what many consider criminalized warfare through the utter othering of the enemy\u2014meaning through exclusionary claims about blood, soil, faith, and morality. Those in identitarian conflicts believe that their circumstances are altogether unique and cannot be readily understood by outsiders. And this helps feed a sense of self-justification in the dramatic escalation of revenge tactics. In the U.S.-Japanese conflict, this othering was often race-based, with a civilizational, East-vs.-West overlay. Each side worked overtime to constantly dehumanize the other. As it has been elsewhere in the past, I believe that in the current conflict, a signal event in the mobilization of such feelings was rape. The rape of Israeli women by Palestinians at the outset of the conflict seems to have packed no less emotional power in rallying Israeli society than the murder of around 1,200 Israeli citizens in Hamas\u2019s surprise Oct. 7 attack. The rapes stirred shock and outrage that galvanized Israel and helped supercharge its entitled sense to escalatory revenge against Palestinian society that has far surpassed the scope of people who can be said to bear any responsibility in the rape and murder of Israelis. For weeks, in both Israel and the Western world, the brutal raping of Israeli women\u2014most of whom were attacked while attending an outdoor concert\u2014remained the focus of persistent coverage and furious indignation. Rape and allegations of rape have played a special role in fueling violent conflicts since ancient times. Historical protagonists, in fact, have usually known this and have often manipulated claims of rape in order to speed mobilization and heighten motivation for retribution. Nicoletta Gullace, a historian at the University of New Hampshire who specializes in World War I, told me that this became a common feature during that conflict. \u201cThere is no question the French were going to be behind fighting because the Germans were heading toward their soil. But for the U.S. and Britain, there needed to be compelling reasons to get the public to accept involvement in a country that a lot of people couldn\u2019t find on a map,\u201d she said. \u201cThere soon came into being a campaign about the rape of Belgium, showing the rape of women, bayonetting babies, allegedly chopping off the breasts of women, allegations that women were being infected with venereal diseases. They spoke of the Germans as Huns, and they were invariably portrayed with pointed hats and very often as gorillas.\u201d Today, few historians contest the idea that German and other armies committed rape during this conflict, but following the widespread political use and manipulation of claims of rape during the war, a consensus about both its extent and the degree of complicity of politicians and commanders has been hard to establish. In Gaza, the retribution came swiftly and terribly, but the enormous catalog of outrages, along with their toll, has continued to mount. Israel, for example, has predominantly relied on dumb munitions, including 2,000-pound bombs, to devastate Gaza\u2019s cities. Weapons like these were designed for open battlefield situations or for use against fortified enemy positions, but Israel is using them in some of the most densely inhabited territory on earth. Israel has also attacked hospitals and refugee camps in Gaza. This has all displaced an enormous percentage of the Palestinian population, and by the latest count killed more than 25,000 people, overwhelmingly women and children. Meanwhile, men in Gaza caught up in the Israeli dragnet have been stripped, beaten, tortured, and simply \u201cvanished.\u201d This would all be remarkably familiar to a historian like Dower, who helped popularize the concept of total war, a give-no-quarter type of conflict that became common in the 20th century, in which races or civilizations and not just armies or men are pit against each other in the minds of the warring parties. To be clear, this includes Hamas, which initiated the current wave of hostilities with its Oct. 7 attack on unarmed civilians in southern Israel. Hamas officials have also spoken of continuing to attack Israel endlessly into the future, or at least until Israel is defeated and disappears. On the Israeli side, from the prime minister down, officials have responded with similarly bloodcurdling and eliminationist rhetoric about Gaza and, by inference, its population. Some have spoken of simply flattening Gaza outright. Others have implied that there is no such thing as an innocent Palestinian. Others still have bruited about the idea of a \u201csolution\u201d that would consist of totally or largely emptying Gaza of its native population. It is publicly aired notions like these, backed up by Israel\u2019s military offensive in the territory, that contributed to South Africa accusing Israel of genocide before the International Court of Justice in The Hague in a case that has been gradually supported by more and more countries. In its first significant action, this tribunal has just ordered Israel to prevent the killing of non-combatants in Gaza while it adjudicates the genocide charge that could take years to decide. All along, the grisly downward spiral in the Israel-Hamas conflict has been about far more than Israeli public opinion following Oct. 7. International opinion has been almost as important, and arguably none more so than that of the United States. Here, too, stories about the rape of Israeli women have been hugely impactful. Just before year\u2019s end, a lengthy New York Times investigation of the use of rape as a weapon of war during Hamas\u2019s bloody incursion into Israel fueled waves of disgust and condemnation of the group. These included individual and gang rapes, but also the beheading of raped women, the cutting off of breasts, other forms of dismemberment, and extreme violence and sexual disfigurement of other kinds. Personally, I harbor no doubt that grave horrors were committed against Israeli women during the Hamas attack, but some critics have said the Times account raised important questions, some of which have never been answered. In fact, some of these critics are people who work in editorial roles inside the Times. A few of them felt so strongly about insufficient corroboration of some of these claims that they reached out to me unsolicited with their complaints, knowing that I had been writing columns about this conflict. These ranged from a general lack of forensic evidence, especially of the kind usually gathered in sexual crimes, to the contradictions to one of the most prominent rape stories raised by the family of a murdered victim. On a more general level, the Times and the Western press have given little or no heed to Hamas\u2019s denials that it organized or ordered the rape of Israelis. The group has claimed that other Palestinian factions or unaffiliated individuals were responsible for these heinous acts. I do not raise this point out of a na\u00efve belief in Hamas\u2019s word or because I doubt that Hamas was capable of committing the rapes that occurred. I raise this question because I believe in a hallowed principle in the journalistic profession that requires giving all of the main parties to any conflict or dispute the opportunity to explain their actions. In war, this often leads to hollow denials and wooden, formulaic statements. But failing to quote the accused party at all leads to even worse outcomes. Speaking more to the historical big picture than to the details of events in Israel and Gaza, from which she has been as remote as I have, Gullace offered this bit of context: \u201cJust because events are being exploited for propaganda purposes does not mean that things like rapes were not occurring. But because of the way these things were being sensationalized, in the postwar period the focus has often become the nature of the propaganda more than a forensic sense of what actually happened.\u201d",

The proximate cause for the latest round of anxiety stems from last week, when Israel assassinated Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, who was in Tehran for the inauguration of Iran\u2019s new president. The killing represented a humiliating intelligence failure for Tehran. And it came just days after a top commander of Hezbollah\u2014another group in Iran\u2019s network of proxies\u2014was killed by an Israeli bomb in Beirut. Iran and its affiliates have vowed to respond, but it\u2019s an open question as to what options they will exercise, and whether that retaliation will further drag the region\u2019s powers into a dangerous escalatory spiral of conflict. To try to piece together what Tehran might be thinking, I spoke with Trita Parsi, a Middle East expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and the former head of the National Iranian American Council. Subscribers can watch the full discussion in the video box atop this page or follow the FP Live podcast for audio. What follows here is a condensed and edited transcript. Ravi Agrawal: Israel hasn\u2019t formally claimed responsibility for the killing of Haniyeh, but it\u2019s generally acknowledged it was likely behind it, and Tehran has said it will respond in kind. It sees the assassination on its own soil\u2014on a big day for the state\u2014as a humiliation. How is Iran gaming out its response? Trita Parsi: The key thing you just said is that this was a profound humiliation of Tehran, and a deliberate one. The Israelis had the capacity to assassinate Haniyeh in other instances, but they chose this one specifically, and I don\u2019t think that was a coincidence. They wanted to maximize the embarrassment, particularly mindful of the fact that Israel is not winning in Gaza. But by maximizing humiliation, they also maximized the likelihood that the Iranians would respond. Iran is, in some ways, trapped in an escalatory cycle because it has abandoned the strategic patience that it had until April. The Iranians have taken a lot of hits from the Israelis, in Syria in particular, and had chosen to play the long game instead of responding. They feared that a response would play into an Israeli effort to drag Iran into an open war at an earlier stage that what Iran is ready for. But after the April 1 bombing of the consular section of the Iranian Embassy in Damascus, the Iranians essentially had enough and switched strategies. At least in the immediate aftermath of the missile attacks, it seemed the Iranians thought that they had managed to restore deterrence. But after this very humiliating assassination, clearly, that was a failure. And because they responded in April, it puts pressure on them to respond now as well. Iran has already abandoned strategic patience. The question is, how do you respond now to this attack (which was, in some ways, worse than what happened in Damascus) without escalating matters into a full-scale war? The Iranians clearly do not want war. In April, they talked about retaliation and restoring deterrence. This time, you\u2019re hearing rhetoric of blood for blood. It suggests that they\u2019re actually looking for casualties, whereas last time, the key objective was to inflict damage on Israel without causing casualties in order to deprive Israel of a pretext for further escalation. In the discussion here in the West, there have been arguments that because the person who was assassinated was not an Iranian official, the Iranians have a way out. The Iranians view it the other way around. Haniyeh was a guest at the inauguration. That actually makes it more important for them to retaliate. This embarrassed them in front of all the different other groups that the Iranians tied to themselves in this \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d Israelis essentially sent the signal that no one from the axis is safe anywhere, and that Tehran cannot protect you. This dramatically reduces Iran\u2019s standing within those different groups, and as a result, the pressure on it to respond is actually greater. RA: As you say, this took place just after the inauguration of the new Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian. He is seen as more of a reformist figure in Iranian politics. But how much say does he actually have in any of the decision-making around this response? TP: Well, we should be careful not to overstate the role and the influence of Iranian presidents, but we should also be careful not to underestimate it. The influence depends on the president himself. Some have actually had a tremendous amount of influence and imposed themselves on the decision-making process or defied the supreme leader. Others have played a much more pliant role. We don\u2019t know yet what type of president Pezeshkian aims to be. But in his rhetoric, he has gone out of his way to say that he is loyal to the supreme leader. He\u2019s not taken on the persona of an anti-establishment candidate. Now, as to the question of timing, I don\u2019t think it can be seen as a coincidence. The reality is, Pezeshkian ran on the platform of restoring diplomacy with the United States and not making that diplomacy contingent upon who ends up in the White House. And this is a very significant shift from the stated position of the Iranians in the last couple of years, as such. After the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) under former President Donald Trump, the Iranian position was to not engage directly with the United States until Washington was back in the deal. That meant that once President Joe Biden came into office, because he wanted to get back into the deal through negotiations instead of through an executive order, the Iranians still officially refused direct engagement. But Pezeshkian ran on a platform of saying that the Iranian economy cannot be fixed unless Iran reengages with the United States and resolves some of those tensions. Given the Israeli opposition to the JCPOA and to U.S.-Iran diplomacy, if the United States and Iran were to resolve their tensions, it would not necessarily reduce Israel and Iran\u2019s tensions. It would leave Israel feeling abandoned by the United States. Nothing really makes it more difficult for Pezeshkian to muster the political space and capital to push through sustained diplomacy with the United States than the humiliation of the kind that we saw the Israelis inflict on Iran. So I suspect that one motivation for doing it on this day was to close a very small, but nevertheless important, window that had been opened for U.S.-Iran diplomacy. RA: What is the general mood in Iran? How much, for example, does the Israel issue matter to the Iranian people? TP: Israel has always been a political football inside of Iran. Iran\u2019s own ills have been at times blamed on Israel. At times, it\u2019s not entirely incorrect. Without Israeli pressure, there would not have been so many sanctions against Iran, and those sanctions have played a critical role in devastating the Iranian economy. Similarly, since the mid-1990s, Iran has been a political football in Israel. Earlier, Israeli officials during the terms of [former Prime Ministers Yitzhak] Rabin and [Shimon] Peres used that potential threat of Iran in order to motivate the Israeli public to support a peace deal with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Essentially, as a Rabin advisor told me, to muster the political will to make peace with Yasser Arafat, whom the Israelis viewed as the main terrorist in the world, there needed to be another, greater threat looming on the horizon. Incidentally, [current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu played down the Iranian threat then, for the very same reason that Rabin played it up. But to your larger question, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any constituency among the population that necessarily would want to see a larger confrontation with Israel. But also, within the regime, I don\u2019t think that constituency is particularly large. The debate is mostly whether to retaliate to restore deterrence or for some other purpose. There\u2019s not really an argument within the system right now favor of an all-out military confrontation. It\u2019s been interesting to see how they\u2019ve been using Iranian TV to whip up support among the population for a limited response against Israel, for the very explicit purpose of restoring deterrence and making sure that the Israelis cannot do this again. RA: More explicitly, how does Iran explain to its people its support of this so-called axis of resistance: Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, all of these groups. How does the regime explain that coalition when in return, Iranians seemingly get humiliations, isolation, sanctions? TP: So you pointed to all of the costs. And I think that\u2019s where the focus tends to be in the West. But we have to recognize that in Iran, there are several different narratives because there are some very distinct constituencies. Some feel very strongly about this issue and feel a strong degree of Islamic sympathy and empathy for other groups and populations in the region. Then there are others who strongly believe that this adds unnecessary headaches to Iran. But we first have to recognize that this has actually given the Iranians a tremendous amount of influence in Iraq, in Lebanon, and elsewhere in the Middle East, precisely because of the investment in some of these different groups. They\u2019re also pointing to the way that these groups act against Israel, saying that this is Iran\u2019s first line of defense against an aggressive Israel or an aggressive United States. Pointing to the fact that immediately after [the U.S. invasion of] Iraq, there were plenty of voices in Washington that said, \u201cyou have to invade Iran.\u201d So they\u2019re pointing to these different investments as creating levers of influence as well as degrees of deterrence against such attacks. RA: There are, broadly, two views of Netanyahu\u2019s actions in recent weeks. One is that he needs a few \u201cbig wins,\u201d however you define them, before he moves forward on a cease-fire. Or the other perspective is that he is trying to distract from Gaza by refocusing global attention, and perhaps egging Tehran on to inspire a domestic jingoistic reaction in Israel. What is your sense of Netanyahu\u2019s motivations? What outcome do you think he\u2019s hoping to achieve? TP: I would go perhaps further than your second scenario. Assassinating the lead negotiator of Hamas does not send the signal that you\u2019re interested in a deal. It\u2019s the most effective way of actually killing negotiations. Then there\u2019s the fact that this was also done within 24 or 48 hours of the assassination of the No. 2 of Hezbollah. Again, it makes it very difficult to believe that this is just done for distraction. But rather, as the world was waiting to see what Hezbollah would do, Israel itself took action and further escalated matters. It\u2019s easy to see Netanyahu as acting precisely because he wanted further escalation and to goad the Iranians and Hezbollah into war. I think we have to recognize that after Oct. 7, 2023, there\u2019s been a very significant shift in the narrative in Israel. Israel lived in belief that it was untouchable, that it was invulnerable, that its military and technological dominance made it so safe that it didn\u2019t have to worry about its safety, nor did it have to worry about striking a deal with the Palestinians\u2014and that it could, every once in a while, bomb Gaza and keep this situation under control. Not only Oct. 7, but also the April attacks, really pierced that perception of Israeli invulnerability both inside and outside of Israel. It also pierced another belief, which was one that the Israelis and I personally shared. I thought that the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the region would not significantly impact the Israelis, because Israel is, at the end of the day, militarily and technologically extremely advanced. Now we see very clearly that that is not the case. If it is in a prolonged state of war, Israel is actually quite dependent on the United States. So, I think there is a degree of shock in Israel, not just over the horrors of Oct. 7, but over that dramatic shift in its position of invulnerability. Those circumstances led to another belief, which is that if Israel miscalculated about Hamas, and Hamas was capable of conducting Oct. 7, then it is intolerable for Israel to live next to Hezbollah, which is a much more powerful group. And as a result, Israel cannot wait for such an attack, but has to take action beforehand. This narrative has taken a pretty strong hold. But with the two assassinations, it\u2019s quite likely that we\u2019re going to see a very significant exchange of fire and a potential larger war there. I don\u2019t think that is something that Netanyahu hoped to avoid, but rather something that he was willing to risk and perhaps even desired. When you listen to some voices inside of Israel, senior Israeli officials such as the former deputy head of the National Security Council, they\u2019re openly accusing Netanyahu of trying to bring about a larger war because it serves his political interests, even though it doesn\u2019t serve the national and security interests of Israel. RA: I wanted to talk more directly about the United States\u2019 role. What do we know about how Vice President Kamala Harris differs from Biden on handling the Middle East? TP: We don\u2019t know a tremendous amount. Without going into details, folks in my organization who have had conversations with her were left with the very strong impression that she actually differs quite a lot from Biden\u2019s perspective on this. And I think it\u2019s not necessarily just because of the empathy that she managed to show in her first comments about this regarding the suffering of the Palestinians\u2014which, I should note, Biden has more or less failed to do over the course of 10 months. It\u2019s also because of an understanding of the politics around this. The Biden administration\u2019s handling leaves a strong impression that its political calculus is based on how the politics of Israel in the United States looked like two or three decades ago. But things have changed quite dramatically, not just over the course of the past 10 months, but even before that. Harris may be a bit closer in her understanding of that reality, particularly when it comes to young people in the United States, and particularly when it comes to certain communities of color in the United States who are increasingly important in the Democratic Party. So that combination points to a likelihood of at least some sort of a shift. The shift that we\u2019ve seen so far has mainly been in tone and rhetoric. And that\u2019s not unimportant in any way, shape, or form. I mean, her body language after the one-on-one meeting with Netanyahu was starkly different from the bear hug that Biden offered. But there was also one issue of substance that I don\u2019t think we should paper over, which is that she told Netanyahu, \u201cTake the deal.\u201d The Biden administration has since started to use that language. Prior to that, the language the administration used was that the problem lay with Hamas, that Hamas was not taking the deal. But she looked at Netanyahu and told him, \u201cTake the deal,\u201d [which] at least implicitly suggests the problem lies with the Israeli prime minister, which many people in Israel completely agree with. That is not just a rhetorical shift. That is a substantive shift. Whether that is followed up with other type of pressures in order to actually move towards a cease-fire remains, of course, to be seen. RA: And on the other hand, what would a Trump-Vance Middle East policy look like, in this particular case? TP: The Trump campaign also does not seem eager to talk too much about this; the politics is actually dicey on their side of the aisle as well. They take a very strong position in favor of Israel, mainly to be able to criticize Biden, saying that he\u2019s abandoning Israel and he\u2019s betraying Israel. But I think there\u2019s some significant concerns on their end not to go too far on that and perhaps shift the conversation toward Ukraine, which they feel more comfortable talking about on the foreign-policy front. The reality is that a large part of Trump\u2019s base has adopted this idea of America First. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s a particularly sophisticated doctrine, but certain elements are strengthening among the grassroots here. They don\u2019t believe the United States should be involved in unnecessary wars and division. They don\u2019t believe the United States should be involved in other countries\u2019 wars. And it\u2019s very difficult for them to then make a massive exception to that principle for the case of Israel. If Trump wins, however, I think there\u2019s a decent likelihood that he will put some significant pressure on the Israelis to, at a minimum, not escalate. Perhaps his administration will not be particularly concerned about Gaza, but it will be concerned about Gaza leading to a larger war that would drag the United States into it. That\u2019s not what Trump wants to deal with in his first year in office.",

                    "post_content": "With the Middle East on the brink of full-scale war, the international community, led by the United States and its allies, faces a critical choice in addressing the conflict in Gaza: gamble on eventual peace through a belligerent Israeli government or enforce a new landmark legal judgment. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion just weeks ago declaring Israel\u2019s continued occupation of the Palestinian territories unlawful and urging its end \u201cas rapidly as possible.\u201d Israel\u2019s illegal actions include the transfer of Israeli civilians into occupied territories, confiscation of Palestinian land, and exploitation of natural resources for the benefit of Israeli settlers. The opinion stated that these practices violate the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Hague Regulations. Israel is party to the former and bound by customary international law to the latter. The ICJ ruling referred implementation of the ruling to the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council, where Washington holds significant sway. For the opinion to be a step toward accountability, the United States and its allies must demonstrate respect for the same rules-based order they once helped establish\u00ad\u00ad\u2013\u2013yet have failed to uphold when it comes to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Washington must employ unilateral or multilateral economic sanctions against the illegal occupation, its settlements, and their institutional underpinnings. Failure to do so risks rendering the ruling a hollow gesture from the highest judicial authority of international law. The ICJ opinion is the latest indication of a growing global consensus that Israel should not be allowed to act with impunity in the Palestinian territories. A senior Australian government source said the ICJ opinion \u201ccan\u2019t be ignored\u201d, and Australia subsequently initiated targeted sanctions to address settler violence; the foreign minister of Germany, one of Israel\u2019s strongest allies, also conceded the gravity of the ruling. Many countries\u2014including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014voted against the U.N. General Assembly resolution that led to this ICJ advisory opinion. Since then, these nations have initiated their own unprecedented sanctions to address at least some aspects of the Israeli occupation\u2014generally following the United States in targeting \u201cbad apples\u201d directly involved in settler violence. Thus far, Israel as a whole has seen no serious repercussions for its flagrant violations of international law. Israeli leaders, businesses, and organizations involved in the occupation and proliferation of illegal settlements have enjoyed global relationships while flouting international law and human rights standards. Meanwhile, close ties with U.S. donors and institutions have facilitated significant funding and support for Israeli expansionism. U.S. state and local governments, for example, have invested billions in Israel Bonds, an investment vehicle that directly supports the Israeli government, while millions of tax-deductible U.S. dollars flow to settler organizations. Since the funds raised by Israel Bonds are deposited into the general Israeli state budget and allocated at the government\u2019s discretion, they are fungible with other budgetary resources. U.S. sanctions targeting settler violence and instability have been slow and performative thus far. On Feb. 1, U.S. President Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14115 to address threats to \u201cpeace, security, and stability in the West Bank.\u201d The power of U.S. sanctions often lies in the intimidating ambiguity of their scope, which is prohibitive for Americans and imposes a chilling effect on non-Americans dealing with the sanctions\u2019 targets. The initial round of sanctions targeted just four people. Immediately, Israeli banks, despite being non-U.S. entities, swiftly halted financial transactions with the sanctions targets. This action prompted backlash in Israel. Then, in late March, the U.S. Treasury Department informed the Bank of Israel in a guidance letter that Israeli banks could facilitate basic living expenses such as food and rent for the violent settlers in question without exposure to sanctions liability. While humanitarian exceptions are standard across U.S. sanctions programs, this blanket guidance appears to be a concession in response to Israeli pressure. What\u2019s more, the letter dilutes the sanctions\u2019 impact by setting clear limits on the ambiguity of enforcement and preserving financial normalcy for the targets. For instance, the guidance prioritizes the wellbeing of the sanctioned individuals\u2019 livestock, which play a key role in seizing control over Palestinian land. Just two months after the guidance was issued, a private recording revealed Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich\u2019s plans to continue using farming outposts, which he described as a \u201cmega-strategic tool\u201d for advancing expansionist goals. Isolated measures that treat violence, land seizures, and human rights abuses as anomalies rather than inherent features of the occupation are inadequate to adhere to the ICJ opinion. An impactful sanctions program must target not only the direct perpetrators of violence but also the broader infrastructure supporting the occupation. The United States must lead or support these efforts because of its monopoly on sanctions, which it derives from the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance in global trade and banking. In recent months, the sanctions initiative at DAWN, an organization promoting democracy and human rights in the Middle East and North Africa, has made multiple submissions to the U.S. government for sanctions designations and enforcement\u00a0against entities involved in the most egregious forms of violence and unlawful conduct in the West Bank. These entities include Tzav 9, the group known for attacks on Gaza aid trucks. Unlike U.S. sanctions programs against Cuba, Iran, and North Korea, which are country-based and harm ordinary civilians, the sanctions DAWN recommends target only specific individuals, entities, and government officials involved in human rights abuses and unlawful conduct in the occupied territories. If these sanctions are met with no change in behavior, an effective program would escalate to target more prominent entities, which could lead to broader economic implications. DAWN\u2019s intended goal, however, is to compel a significant policy shift at the highest levels of the Israeli government while the consequences of any sanctions remain targeted. To act on the ICJ opinion and the official U.S. foreign policy objective of a two-state solution, the Biden administration must explicitly acknowledge that the illegality of Israeli\u2019s occupation is the root cause of the West Bank\u2019s violence and instability. A meaningful sanctions program would carry the potential to eventually include major entities such as banks that finance or support the illegal settlements. There is already some movement in this direction. Just over a month ago, Canada imposed sanctions on Amana, a leading West Bank settlement organization. (Israeli nongovernmental organization Peace Now estimates Amana\u2019s assets at $160 million and reports that it has established or is advancing more than half of the 146 settlements in the West Bank.) Canada has also singled out Daniella Weiss, a controversial figure who leads the Nachala Movement, which focuses on initiating illegal outposts in the West Bank and reestablishing settlements in Gaza. While initially deferring to its allies\u2019 targeted strategies, Canada has demonstrated a more assertive stance by setting a precedent that institutional stakeholders are also targets in the effort to hold Israel accountable. Canada\u2014which in December 2022 voted against the U.N. General Assembly resolution that led to the ICJ ruling\u2014should be commended for its actions. But the Canadian sanctions\u2019 impact is limited due to their lack of extraterritorial reach. By contrast, U.S. sanctions on anyone tend to have a global impact because of the U.S. dollar\u2019s dominance in global trade. As the world\u2019s primary reserve currency, the dollar has wide use in international trade and is held by central banks as part of their reserves. This dominance grants the United States significant leverage over global financial activities, enabling its sanctions to disrupt transactions beyond its borders. Additionally, the United States allocates substantial resources to its sanctions programs due to its extensive enforcement capabilities and influence over global financial institutions and commerce. Only unilateral U.S. sanctions or multilateral sanctions backed by the United States can exert the necessary pressure on Israel to halt its illegal activities across the occupied territories. A meaningful global sanctions effort could achieve this in two ways: U.N. sanctions or multilateral sanctions. The former would require the United States to make the unprecedented move of refraining from vetoing any Chapter VII U.N. Security Council resolution regarding Israel\u2019s illegal activities. The latter, an arguably less politically challenging approach, would require the United States to organize multilateral sanctions in coordination with its allies\u2014akin to those initiated in response to Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. U.S.-enabled Israeli impunity has led us to this point, but U.S.-led sanctions can also be the solution. The United States has a moral responsibility to lead the global sanctions effort against Israel. Together with its allies, the United States should build on Canada\u2019s recent actions and intensify coordinated efforts to impose sanctions on individuals and organizations involved in sustaining the occupation and its associated illegal activities. The goal would be to significantly increase the economic cost of sustaining the occupation and associated apartheid policies, compelling a policy shift at the highest levels of the Israeli government. The ICJ ruling provides the legal and moral foundation for such an effort and may serve as the basis for a just, long-term geopolitical resolution that both the Palestinian and Israeli people deserve. If\u00a0Washington ignores the ICJ ruling, it will further entrench a culture of Israeli impunity on the international stage. To maintain its role as the leader of the rules-based order it helped establish, the United States must finally show Israel\u2014one of its closest allies\u2014some tough love.",

                    "post_content": "In the weeks since U.S. President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race on July 21, news outlets have focused on shifts in public opinion polls and election prediction markets. Pundits have weighed in on whether former U.S. President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris\u2014now the presumptive Democratic nominee\u2014will win in November, as well as what the consequences may be for U.S. foreign policy. International relations (IR) scholars have a unique perspective on these questions\u2014and particularly on the effects of the outcome of the Nov. 5 election on U.S. foreign policy. The Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) Project at William &amp; Mary\u2019s Global Research Institute, with support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, recently surveyed IR scholars at U.S. colleges and universities about these issues. The results reported below are based on responses from 379 IR experts, most of whom are political scientists, surveyed between July 18 and 23. (Complete results can be found here.) Survey respondents were asked their opinions about a range of potential Democratic replacements if Biden left the race, as well as their estimation of the probability that these candidates might prevail in November. The survey was open when Biden announced he would withdraw from the race, but most responses came before his withdrawal from the race. The IR experts largely supported Harris and believed that she could win in November, even before public polls shifted in her favor\u2014a preference that seems tied at least in part to concerns about how Trump would handle an international crisis. Who will win the U.S. presidential election? A public opinion survey conducted by YouGov from July 19 to July 21, the day Biden withdrew, asked respondents who would win a November election between Trump and Biden and a then-hypothetical election between Trump and Harris. At the time, 21 percent of respondents said Biden would definitely or probably win, while 23 percent predicted a Harris victory. Trump fared considerably better, with 57 percent and 55 percent of respondents predicting his victory, respectively. (Other responses included \u201cnot sure\u201d and that the two candidates were \u201cequally likely\u201d to win.) In short, at the moment Biden withdrew from the race, the U.S. public believed Harris would fare only marginally better than Biden and that Trump was likely to beat either Democrat. The IR experts\u2014surveyed the same week\u2014disagreed. The TRIP survey asked respondents to estimate the probability that Harris would win against Trump in November if she replaced Biden on the Democratic ticket, as well as the probability that Biden would win if the election were between Biden and Trump. The political scientists we surveyed had much greater confidence in Harris\u2019s prospects for victory: On average, respondents estimated that Harris had a 52 percent probability of winning, compared with only a 36 percent probability that Biden would defeat Trump. Who do IR scholars want as U.S. president? Our survey results also reveal a clear preference for Harris over Biden as the next U.S. president. When presented with 10 potential candidates for president, 20 percent of the foreign-policy experts reported that they would like to see Harris as the next president, while 9 percent preferred Biden and only 2 percent preferred Trump. (The other options were Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and \u201cOther.\u201d) To some extent, the bias toward Harris and other possible Democratic candidates reflects the fact that 70 percent of the surveyed experts self-identified as Democrats. Nevertheless, just over half of Republicans in our sample selected Trump as their preferred candidate, with Harris garnering 9 percent support from this group. Among Democrats, 23 percent of respondents chose Harris, narrowly making her the second choice behind Whitmer. Ten percent of Democratic respondents chose Biden. Trump did not receive any support among Democrats. Although Harris outperformed Biden among the IR experts surveyed in our poll, an Emerson College survey of public opinion conducted earlier, on July 7 and 8, found that Harris and Biden performed equally in a head-to-head matchup against Trump. In fact, all nine potential Democratic nominees listed in the TRIP survey fared similarly in the Emerson College survey (within 5 percentage points), but the TRIP-surveyed experts had more varied preferences. In the weeks since our survey closed, the gap between the public and the experts has narrowed, with increased support among the public for Harris. Comparing two Economist/YouGov opinion polls taken on July 21-23 and Aug. 4-6, when respondents were asked whom they planned to vote for in the presidential election, support for Trump decreased from 44 percent to 43 percent, while support for Harris increased from 41 percent to 45 percent. Who do IR scholars trust in a crisis? When asked about the candidates\u2019 ability \u201cto handle a major international crisis as president,\u201d the surveyed IR experts rated Biden and Harris similarly. However, there was a huge gulf between the Democrats and Republicans on the issue. Survey respondents were asked to indicate their trust in each candidate on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating a complete lack of trust and 100 indicating complete trust. The scholars signaled an average trust level of 68 for Harris and 70 for Biden, but Trump averaged more than 50 points lower, at 16 on the 100-point scale. Self-identified Republicans expressed greater trust in Trump; among these respondents, he scored an average of 55. But these Republican experts trusted the former president much less than Democratic experts trusted Harris. This trust gap may be a better measure of confidence in either candidate\u2019s foreign-policy acumen than a simple comparison of experts\u2019 support for their chosen party\u2019s nominee. Respondents who self-identified as independent voters also had significantly more trust in Harris (+38) than Trump to handle a foreign-policy crisis. The experts also differ sharply from the public in their assessment of the candidates\u2019 foreign-policy abilities. The July 19-21 YouGov poll asked respondents, \u201cIf you had to say, who do you think would do a better job handling foreign policy as president if elected this year?\u201d Unlike the IR experts, 44 percent of U.S. adults favored Trump, while 32 percent preferred Harris. Partisanship also is stronger among the public than the experts. Fully 87 percent of Republicans in the public opinion survey thought that Trump would do a better job at foreign policy. By comparison, Trump scored only an average of 55 out of 100 among Republican foreign-policy experts when they were asked if they trust him to handle a major international crisis. Theoretical paradigms offer another possible explanation for IR scholars\u2019 trust in the different candidates\u2019 foreign-policy skills and judgment. Increasingly, self-described realists have promoted a U.S. grand strategy of restraint\u2014which discourages military interventions abroad, warns against expanding alliances such as NATO, and discounts the relevance of international rules as a guide to U.S. foreign policy. This stands in contrast to a more liberal U.S. grand strategy of engagement. But even realist experts are skeptical of another Trump term, as the TRIP survey shows. To start, most realists don\u2019t support Trump\u2019s presidential bid. When given a list of 10 possible candidates, 17 percent of realist respondents preferred that Harris become president, compared with 8 percent who preferred Trump. Although realist scholars were much more likely than liberals, constructivists, or non-paradigmatic scholars to trust Trump, they still trusted Harris more than Trump in a crisis. On a 100-point scale, realist scholars on average rate their trust in Trump\u2019s ability to handle a foreign-policy crisis 14 points higher than non-realist scholars do. Those who identify with any other IR theory trust Harris more\u2014averaging 15 points higher than realists. It should not be surprising that realists\u2019 average trust in Trump is twice that of non-realists, given both his rhetorical support for more restraint as president and his recommitment to delivering an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy if he were re-elected. At the same time, realists express an average level of trust in Harris to handle a major international crisis of 56 on a 100-point scale, compared with only an average trust level of 28 in Trump. The lower trust in Trump among realist scholars may reflect the fact that both realists and Republicans have traditionally advocated a more internationalist foreign policy built around alliances and the limited use of military force to maintain the balance of power, rather than Trump\u2019s skepticism of alliances and greater focus on domestic issues. Much has changed since Biden and Trump took the debate stage in June. With Harris now topping the Democratic ticket, IR experts both want her to defeat Trump in November\u2014and think that she can. The experts\u2019 strong preference for Harris is likely explained at least in part by the fact that they don\u2019t particularly trust Trump to handle an international crisis. As the election season enters its final stretch, it\u2019s clear that the people who know the most about U.S. foreign policy and international politics remain worried about a possible Trump victory. It\u2019s also clear that with Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza still ongoing, whoever wins in November will face numerous foreign-policy challenges.",

                    "post_content": "From Oprah Winfrey to the Clintons and the Obamas, a star-studded Democratic National Convention (DNC) came to a close on Thursday night in Chicago with Vice President Kamala Harris formally accepting her party\u2019s presidential nomination. Foreign policy rarely plays a big role in conventions, which are largely about party unity and generating excitement; but even so, Harris attempted to make the case for her national security bonafides. \u201cI will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world,\u201d she declared, before asserting she would focus on besting China in \u201cthe competition for the 21st century. Beyond the rhetoric, what have we learned so far about Harris\u2019s foreign policy? I spoke with Anne-Marie Slaughter and Matt Duss on FP Live the morning after the DNC. Slaughter is a former head of the State Department\u2019s policy planning department, while Duss served for many years as a foreign-policy advisor to Sen. Bernie Sanders. Subscribers can watch the full discussion on the video box atop this page. What follows is a condensed and edited transcript. Ravi Agrawal: Matt, you\u2019re in Chicago at the scene of the action. What were your takeaways from the DNC, and especially from Harris\u2019s speech? Matt Duss: In general, it was a pretty good week. Everyone was feeling good. I think it went off very smoothly. We saw the outlines of a pro-worker agenda. This builds on what we saw from President Joe Biden\u2014investments in the American people dealing with cost of living. And as I wrote in FP, there are big international foreign-policy implications for this; but that was the major focus of the first three days. Obviously, there was also a focus on the danger of former President Donald Trump and what he represents not only domestically, but also the phenomenon of autocracy and authoritarianism globally. Thursday is when we saw much more of a general focus on the issue of foreign policy and national security with a number of veterans, members of Congress with national security backgrounds, and the former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta coming out on stage. Part of last night\u2019s agenda was to demonstrate that Harris meets the threshold test of being commander in chief. RA: Anne-Marie, you\u2019ve written in the Financial Times that Harris\u2019s mantra is likely to be a version of \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d It struck me that she tried to do exactly that when she spoke last night. Anne-Marie Slaughter: Yes, I would say what came through very strongly in her speech is strength. The intro video and the first part of her speech projected, \u201cI\u2019m a fighter; I\u2019m a protector; I am strong; I stand up for people against perpetrators.\u201d And so she went through that domestically as a prosecutor, and then segued to \u201cI will keep this country strong and secure\u201d and \u201cI will stand for us in the world.\u201d There were two other things that struck me. One, and many people have commented on it, the speech was deeply patriotic. I just loved it. If you hadn\u2019t heard the sound, you may have thought this was a Republican convention, from the Pledge of Allegiance to chants of \u201cUSA\u201d (which often makes me a little bit uncomfortable). But she is proud to be an American. She loves this country. The third thing was her mantra of freedom. Jonathan Haidt wrote one of his first books about the values of conservatives and liberals and that liberals tend to focus on equality and justice and conservatives focus on liberty and authority and loyalty. She flipped the script. She was all about freedom\u2014from Beyonce\u2019s music to, more importantly, the freedom to be freed from government interference in human choices, women\u2019s choices, and reproductive rights. And again, she segued from \u201cI stand for freedom for women to control their bodies\u201d to freedom in terms of civil rights so all Americans have an equal shot, and then right into: \u201cI stand for freedom in the world. I stand for the United States against tyranny.\u201d What you didn\u2019t hear was Biden\u2019s democracies versus autocracies dimension. It was much more personal. It was \u201cPutin is a tyrant,\u201d and we know where we stand against tyrants. She made that crack about how Trump doesn\u2019t stand up to them because he wants to be one. What I came away with was strength and freedom and patriotism. RA: Matt, I thought she walked a fine line on the Middle East, showing empathy to both Israelis and Palestinians. And on that latter part, it seemed to me that she was trying to create a tiny bit of daylight between herself and Biden. But ultimately it was rhetoric. We don\u2019t know what exactly she\u2019s going to do. MD: This is language we\u2019ve heard from her before. I think she created daylight with Biden months ago, particularly with the speech she gave in Selma, Alabama. She was much more critical of Israeli policy and lifted up the Palestinian humanitarian crisis in Gaza more than Biden had done. I personally understand the line she was trying to walk. But I was disappointed in what I heard last night. We heard very effusive and detailed support for Israel in the wake of Oct. 7, 2023. And then we saw some vague support for Palestinians\u2019 rights to self-determination. I know there was a lot of work that was done and she had requests from the Uncommitted Movement and others. There were hopes that we might see something a bit more specific or forward-leaning. I don\u2019t think we got it last night. We\u2019re still in a campaign, so we didn\u2019t expect to see great detail last night. But this is really a question that I and others have: Is she ready to move forward and represent the Democratic Party of today, not only in domestic but also in foreign policy? As we all know, the issue of Gaza has been really divisive in the party. I think this is something many of us are going to be hoping to hear more from her on in the future. RA: Matt, you\u2019ve written about this in Foreign Policy, offering concrete proposals for what Harris should do when it comes to Gaza and the Middle East. You\u2019ve said that she should cut military aid to Israel. She should increase aid to UNRWA. Can you expand on that? MD: It\u2019s not just cutting aid. It\u2019s upholding U.S. law regarding military aid, which is something that could flow very easily from her past as a prosecutor and as someone who has spoken quite eloquently about international law and international norms and standards. The fact of the matter is we are seeing very credible evidence of repeated instances of international humanitarian law violations by the Israeli military over these past ten months. And we also have laws here in the United States that govern the use of American-provided weapons. So I think many are hoping to see some sign that she would enforce these laws and suspend military aid if there is evidence of human-rights violations and of atrocities because we have not seen this from Biden. RA: Anne-Marie, obviously there\u2019s some disappointment on that element of Middle East policy. But she does have to walk this fine line because she could risk upsetting other parts of the party if she changes too much from what the Biden administration has done so far. AMS: I heard her quite differently. Her line was, \u201cThe Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination.\u201d That was one of the biggest applause lines of her entire speech. I agree that she was very specific on supporting Israel\u2019s right to defend itself and making sure it had the capacity to defend itself. But I heard her saying: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to split the party right now. I am not going to give Donald Trump an opening here.\u201d And remember, previously, when the pro-Palestinian demonstrators interrupted her speech, she said: \u201cIf you want Donald Trump to win, then say that. Otherwise I am speaking.\u201d What I heard last night was: \u201cI hear the entire package for Palestine, and I see the devastation, and I see the horrors, and we are doing everything we can to stop this war. And after this war, here\u2019s what the Palestinian people need. But I am not going to open even a crack that will let the Republicans paint me as soft on Israel.\u201d RA: Do you think that that could be successful politically? AMS: I do. I\u2019m glad that we have people in the party, including the Uncommitteds, who are insisting that we focus on the human dimension of this horrific conflict and not just the geopolitics of it. And I think she has made clear that she sees the human dimension. But I think fundamentally, people are not going to want to divide the party in a way that would prevent her from continuing the desire for a cease-fire and a permanent settlement. Everybody in the Democratic Party has to know that if Trump is elected, that\u2019s the end of American support for any Palestinian self-determination. So I think that was the right call politically, even if inevitably it was going to disappoint some of her supporters. MD: That statement about Palestinian rights and Palestinian self-determination and humanity coming from that stage, from the candidate, is important. I think we should recognize that. But I do note the contrast in the specificity toward Israel and the kind of vague remarks on the Palestinians. Even her comment of \u201cwhat has happened in Gaza.\u201d This is not a natural disaster. This is not a flood or a tornado. This is Gaza being obliterated by a military that is subsidized by the United States and using American bombs. RA: Broadening out, we didn\u2019t learn much that is new this week about what a potential Harris foreign policy could look like. But, what is your sense of the broader themes and interests that might animate a Harris White House? AMS: The thing that I notice the most in her speeches and her background is an equal weighting of what I would call the global threats and the geopolitical threats. She made very clear she is going to stand with Ukraine and continue mobilizing all of our allies against Russia. She said we can\u2019t let China win either in space or AI. She was very strong on North Korea and Iran. She checked all those boxes. But she also said earlier: \u201cAs a prosecutor, I fought the cartels that traffic in drugs and guns and people. And those were hard fights. And they are important fights.\u201d I\u2019ve heard her three times at the Munich Security Conference. She always talks about climate, and she doesn\u2019t talk about climate as an afterthought. She talks about development crises and about health as well as about standing firm against aggressive states and states that are threatening the United States. So I expect from her a much more integrated focus on the full spectrum of national security. I\u2019m glad that you don\u2019t hear this line about democracies versus autocracies from her. I think that signals a shift to a more pragmatic outlook. For example, we have to deal with Saudi Arabia because we\u2019re not going to get Palestinian self-determination without Saudi Arabia and others. Lastly, I\u2019ll expect a much greater focus on Africa and Latin America. She talks about both. Again, she is a new American president. She herself comes from a mixed background. She lived in the state that has the largest Hispanic population and just reflects this unbelievable diversity. And so I expect to see her focusing more on parts of the world that traditional folks of European American background would focus less on. RA: Anne-Marie, Harris\u2019s chief foreign policy advisor is Phil Gordon. You know him and cited him in your recent piece in the Financial Times. How much influence can a potential national security advisor have in crafting a president\u2019s foreign policy? And what do you expect from someone like Gordon? AMS: Gordon\u2019s a lot like Secretary of State Antony Blinken in that you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find anybody in Washington who doesn\u2019t like him or respect him. He is one of these people who\u2019s been around a long time, and he\u2019s worked with many different people. He\u2019s got a reputation as a straight shooter and as someone who is highly competent and pragmatic. In his most recent book on the Middle East, he comes out against regime change because it just doesn\u2019t end well. He\u2019s not a deeply ideological person. He is committed to peace and prosperity and defending American interests. He has strong interests in Europe. He was the assistant secretary for Europe when I was at State. That is a brutally hard job because you\u2019re traveling constantly. I think it\u2019s very helpful that he knows Europe and the Middle East, particularly now. But overall, with him, I think you\u2019d get pragmatism, competence, and a focus on maintaining close ties with lots of allies without a particular ideological or even doctrinal tag. RA: Gordon has a deputy, Rebecca Lissner. We asked one of our columnists, Michael Hirsh, to do a close reading of their two most recent books. So you just mentioned, Anne-Marie, Gordon\u2019s book: Losing the Long Game: The False Promise of Regime Change in the Middle East. And Rebecca Lissner\u2019s book: An Open World: How America Can Win the Contest for 21st Century Order. Hirsh\u2019s take is that both books argue for a less hubristic America, a less arrogant America, perhaps an America that is looking to enforce a rules-based, liberal international order. Matt, is that your sense of an emerging Harris doctrine? MD: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go that far. I think the through line of those books is a sense of rethinking American foreign policy. We are in a moment where I think the old consensus has come apart. The question is, what is the new consensus? Can we build a new shared foreign-policy consensus? The project is actually much bigger. The question is, can we build a shared vision of the American project, such that we can have a durable expression of that project in foreign policy? If we are talking about a more humble foreign policy, if that means we\u2019re not going to invade and occupy more countries and try and do regime change, I think that\u2019s good. If that means we\u2019re not going to try and uphold a shared set of human rights standards and values, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good. So I think the question is, where are we going to continue to lean forward and where are we going to pull back? I think Biden\u2019s administration still has commitments ideologically to global primacy and I am hoping a President Harris would move away from that. RA: Some of what we heard from Harris last night did signal primacy. But there is a generational shift. She clearly has tapped into a broad bipartisan desire not to get mired in too many conflicts. As you\u2019ve pointed out, she\u2019s also thinking more about climate change and AI, in a way that is quite forward looking. AMS: I think she was checking the box of making sure she could be commander in chief. She does not look like what most people think of when they think commander in chief, so she absolutely nailed that one down, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world.\u201d She also said\u2014and this is that duality in her\u2014that, \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of the soldiers.\u201d I don\u2019t know that she\u2019d go as far as Lissner and Mira Rapp-Hooper\u2019s book, which basically says the job of the United States is to maintain a world free of spheres of influence, including making sure that China doesn\u2019t have its sphere in Asia and Iran in the Middle East. But that\u2019s a quite minimalist view. It\u2019s fairly evident to me, hearing where Harris is on Ukraine, that she wouldn\u2019t go for that. I do think though that her definition of American greatness is also about the power of our example. When she was talking about freedom, I was really interested. I kept thinking, what does she mean here? What\u2019s her definition of freedom? And she kept tying it to opportunity. She really closed as she crescendoed: America is the land of opportunity for everyone and that all Americans have the opportunity to achieve what they want to achieve. You can easily expand that around the world and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to work on human-rights issues.\u201d The trade issues are hard because what is good for Americans often here with jobs is not so good for many people around the world. Those are very hard choices. But I could hear her defining America as a global leader. She said, I\u2019m going to strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. I could hear that on a whole set of issues around global health, around climate, around development issues including education, food security, and water security, in a way that would flow pretty seamlessly from what she\u2019s trying to do also at home.",

                    "post_excerpt": "As world leaders descend on U.N. headquarters, a Russian gambit on Sunday underscored tensions at the summit.",
                    "post_content": "The annual pilgrimage of world leaders to the United Nations headquarters in New York struck a false note on Sunday\u2014though it certainly wasn\u2019t the fault of renowned soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming, who serenaded the delegates as they took their seats. Events quickly took an interesting turn as the Russian delegation, engaging in last-minute brinksmanship, tried to shoehorn in a surprise amendment to the outcome document of the Summit of the Future, which came ahead of the high-level U.N. General Assembly week. Joe Biden will address the assembly for the last time as the president of the United States on Tuesday amid other speeches this week from royalty, presidents, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. But for the two days beforehand, politicians and top diplomats convened at the Summit of the Future, a one-off event initiated by U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who urged world leaders to rethink the U.N. system, which he perceives as not fit for purpose to solve modern-day problems. However, the acrimonious negotiations over the summit\u2019s outcome document\u2014the Pact for the Future\u2014only underscored the U.N. system\u2019s dysfunction. Since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and amid spiraling conflict in the Middle East, many U.N. watchers say the system has become a venue for posturing rather than a place for parties with different interests to come together to reach compromise. The 56-page Pact for the Future covers topics from artificial intelligence to gender equality and reflects input from the 193 U.N. member states. Much of the text treads familiar ground, but Guterres hoped to spark debate that would reshape global governance structures. It\u2019s far from clear if that will be the eventual outcome. David Miliband, the chief executive of the International Rescue Committee and a former U.K. politician, preferred to reframe the debate: \u201cThe point about international humanitarian law is not that it needs to be changed\u2014it needs to be observed,\u201d he said. Down to the wire, challenges persisted from 19 countries\u2014particularly petrostates that aimed to soften the pact\u2019s stance on climate change. Some diplomats griped that in certain regards, the document fell short of the standards set at the annual U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to bring ourselves back to language agreed at COP,\u201d one senior diplomat said last Friday, dubbing Russia\u2019s lengthy list of objections to passages on topics such as disarmament and digital technology as \u201cmischief.\u201d On Sunday morning, the U.N. General Assembly was compelled to consider a last-minute amendment proposed by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin that would have diluted the pact and called on the secretary-general to submit a report next year, slowing down the process. Vershinin said Russia would \u201cdistance itself from the consensus on this document and on the Global Digital Compact\u201d if its amendment was not included in the pact\u2019s text. Representing Africa\u2019s 54 member states, which opposed Russia\u2019s amendment, the Republic of Congo made a motion not to vote on it. Only seven countries including Russia supported the amendment, while 143 voted not to consider it. Then, the assembly shrugged off the objections of Russia and a handful of like-minded member states and celebrated the approval of the pact by consensus. Despite the contentious negotiations, much in the pact could help shape everyday life, especially on issues such as climate change and new digital technology, said Robert Wood, the deputy U.S. envoy to the United Nations. He said U.S. diplomats had invested significant time and energy, from the early stages of drafting the document more than a year ago to building as much consensus as possible, particularly with countries in the global south. Guterres, who may have conceived of the Pact for the Future as a legacy-building project, spent much of last week publicly pleading delegates to compromise. His remarks betrayed some exasperation, such as when he said at a curtain-raising press briefing that \u201cthe secretary-general of the United Nations has very limited power, and it\u2019s also absolutely true that he has very little capacity to mobilize financial resources. So, no power and no money.\u201d At the U.N. headquarters, the tension is palpable amid global conflicts, as well as financial challenges within the organization. Guterres\u2019s plea to member states that are in arrears on their financial contributions to the U.N. to pay up reflects this strain more than a year into a hiring freeze and other cutbacks. \u201cMany of the staff remain worried about the state of the U.N.\u2019s budget and the implications that will have both on their contract renewals and the amount of work placed on them because of the hiring freeze,\u201d Maya Ungar, a U.N. analyst at the International Crisis Group, wrote in an email. There was a notable absence at the Summit of the Future: U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president. Last week, rumors circulated in the corridors of the U.N. that she might take the stage in what some diplomats hoped would be a dress rehearsal. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Monday instead. The fear of a second term for former President Donald Trump runs deep at the United Nations; as president, he showed disdain for multilateral institutions and made funding cuts to U.N. organizations. The high-level week at the U.N. General Assembly will feature a few debut appearances. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, elected in July after the death of his predecessor Ebrahim Raisi, will address the assembly on Tuesday; British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who also took office in July, will speak on Friday. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron will return after a year\u2019s absence and speak on Wednesday amid challenges with his new government back home. As for China and Russia, Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will again delegate representation at the summit to their ministers. Doubtless all eyes will be on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Netanyahu will address the assembly ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that plunged the region into renewed conflict\u2014and amid escalation across Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon. Zelensky scored a hat trick: speaking to the Summit of the Future on Monday, a Security Council session about Ukraine on Tuesday, and the General Assembly on Wednesday. Zelensky stole the show at the opening of the last year\u2019s high-level week; this year, Ukraine hasn\u2019t even made some lists of top concerns at the United Nations. Nevertheless, the Security Council will convene for a briefing on Tuesday about Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. On Wednesday, the Security Council will hold an open debate on peace and security that will include the often-overlooked conflict in Sudan. Former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf will speak, and the meeting will be chaired by Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, whose country holds the rotating Security Council presidency this month. \u201cEach of these conflicts endangers regional peace and security, and the threat of a veto should not cause us to shy away from discussing these topics and trying to find solutions,\u201d Golob wrote in a message. The conflict in Sudan is gaining increased attention this year in New York. Renewed clashes between the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have left the U.N. on the sidelines for more than a year, even as the threat of famine looms. Diplomats believe that as the Sudanese conflict doesn\u2019t align with the geostrategic interests of any of the five permanent Security Council members\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014the U.N. should be able to do more to address the crisis. The real action at the U.N. high-level week takes place in the wings. Zelensky will be busy with meetings on the margins to secure support for Ukraine\u2019s peace proposal and seek fresh arms and permissions to use them to strike inside Russia. Netanyahu will likely advocate for Israel\u2019s security concerns at the U.N., where he once served an unhappy stint as the country\u2019s envoy. Last week, deepening conflict in Gaza and Lebanon took center stage every day. At afterparties this week, one hot topic may be recent remarks by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield at the Council on Foreign Relations, in which \u00a0she expressed the U.S. commitment to support two new permanent Security Council seats for Africa and a rotating seat for small island developing states. Wood, the deputy U.S. envoy, told Foreign Policy that the United States fundamentally disagrees with the view that the Security Council is not a useful mechanism to address the problems of the world today while expressing commitment to trying to bring about Security Council reform through the intergovernmental negotiations process. \u201cWe think now this is an opportunity to reshape the council in a way that makes it more credible, legitimate, and effective in the eyes of the international community,\u201d he said in an interview on Monday. But what lingers after the last champagne cork has been swept away at the end of the week could be the Sunday morning vote in the General Assembly. The countries supporting Russia were Belarus, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria\u2014a tally closely mirroring that of the lopsided General Assembly votes following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when Russia was largely isolated. Moscow had since seemed to make diplomatic headway with global south countries through strategic talks and some clever grain diplomacy\u2014but it was not so on Sunday. \u201cDeveloping countries had been making it clear behind the scenes that they didn\u2019t want Moscow to block the pact,\u201d said Richard Gowan, the U.N. director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cI think that\u00a0the Russians were trying to look tough but in the end just looked a bit silly.\u201d Time will tell whether Russia has overplayed its hand\u2014but at the very least, some observers felt the Sunday gambit was a bit of clumsy diplomacy.",

                    "post_content": "In the year since Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack, Israel has gone from looking more vulnerable than it has for half a century\u2014when it almost lost the 1973 Arab-Israeli War\u2014to dramatically restoring its strategic edge against Iran and its proxies and, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, changing \u201cthe balance of power in the region for years to come\u201d in its favor. That, in sum, is the conclusion of many military and national security experts following several months of devastating\u2014and mostly unanswered\u2014Israeli attacks. Since the spring, these operations have killed off senior commanders of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC); taken out Hamas\u2019s political leader in the heart of Tehran and its top general in Gaza; and with a stunningly swift series of sophisticated blows both disabled and decapitated Hezbollah. On Tuesday, Israel\u2019s military and technological dominance was reaffirmed further when Iran\u2014retaliating after months of dithering\u2014failed to kill or even seriously injure a single Israeli (the only reported death was a Palestinian in Jericho) despite an unprecedentedly large ballistic missile attack on Israeli air bases and its Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv. This success was largely thanks to Israel\u2019s state-of-the-art multilayer air defense systems. But it is only now, perhaps, that the real tests are to come\u2014both military and diplomatic. Israel will certainly retaliate directly against Iran for Tehran\u2019s latest missile attack. But the decision it has to make is whether to keep the status quo as it resumes mopping up Hamas in Gaza and neutralizing Hezbollah on the ground in Lebanon\u2014or whether it takes the fight to the Iranian regime itself, including its leadership and possibly its nuclear program. And for Israel\u2019s No. 1 ally, the United States, the question is whether U.S. President Joe Biden and his vice president, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, can prevent such a politically hazardous escalation with little over a month to go in a very tight U.S. presidential election. On Tuesday, Harris\u2019s Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, said the Iranian missile strike against Israel only exposed the lack of leadership from the Biden-Harris administration and pushed the world closer to a \u201cglobal catastrophe.\u201d There are many in Israel who, suddenly full of confidence a year into what has come to be seen as an existential fight against Iran and its proxies, now want a wider war against Tehran. \u201cFor Israel, Judgment Day has arrived,\u201d said Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former CIA officer now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD). \u201cThe go-big argument has more currency in Israel now. Oct. 7 and [Iranian Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei\u2019s subsequent audacity have likely changed Israeli risk tolerance.\u201d Many Israeli hawks, such as former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, believe Iran\u2019s brazen willingness to fire ballistic missiles directly at Israel\u2014not once but twice since a retaliatory attack in April\u2014should be a trigger for a decisive response that eliminates any strategic threat from Tehran. \u201cIsrael has now its greatest opportunity in 50 years, to change the face of the Middle East,\u201d Bennett posted on X on Oct. 1. \u201cWe have the justification. We have the tools. Now that Hezbollah and Hamas are paralyzed, Iran stands exposed.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that if the Israelis don\u2019t go big after Iran\u2019s second invitation for them to do so, then they have accepted the Iranian bomb,\u201d said Gerecht, who also sees an attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear program as a strategic imperative. Israel has a \u201cperplexing question before it: If they strike Iran in any significant way (oil industry, military installations, senior leadership, including Khamenei) but don\u2019t go after the nuclear weapon infrastructure, then they could wound the theocracy but leave intact the one weapon that can deter further Israeli retaliation for Iranian machinations.\u201d But such an escalation is the last kind of response that Biden and Harris want to see right now. As a proverbial \u201cOctober surprise,\u201d it would entail a major regional war that would almost certainly suck in the U.S. military and possibly cause American casualties, imperiling Harris\u2019s chances on Nov. 5. So the main diplomatic question is whether Biden can muster the leverage to prevent an escalating series of Israeli strikes either on Iran\u2019s leaders or its critical infrastructure facilities that would mean a full-blown war. Indeed, it\u2019s very possible that Iran timed and calibrated its Tuesday attack knowing that Biden and Harris would work overtime to avoid a wider war. \u201cI think the Iranians are banking on a Hail Mary\u201d from the United States to prevent an all-out war, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at FDD and an expert on Iran\u2019s missile capabilities. Recent months do not supply much cause for hope that U.S. diplomacy can make headway\u2014especially since Biden became a lame duck with his July 21 announcement that he would not, after all, run for a second term at the age of 81. Even before then, Netanyahu was openly tweaking the U.S. president, repeatedly ignoring U.S. pleas for restraint and seeming to agree to a U.S. cease-fire proposal for Gaza and then undercutting it. Still, for most the past year at least, Netanyahu appeared to be deferring to U.S. pleas to not open a new front against Hezbollah and Lebanon. That all ended in September when, without even notifying Washington of its plans, Israel opened up that front with a high-tech sabotaging of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies, killing at least 42 people and wounding thousands. It then assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a senior IRGC commander, Abbas Nilforoushan, and followed up with a limited ground invasion, which is ongoing. For Biden, the biggest problem is that \u201cWashington is boxed into a corner,\u201d said Nimrod Novik, a former senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. \u201cAny demonstration of daylight between the U.S. and Israel is bound to embolden all hostiles\u2014Iran included. So Washington must stand by Israel even when it attacks, though thus far every American statement accentuated a commitment to defend Israel when attacked.\u201d And whatever Israel does now, Ben Taleblu said, \u201cI think it\u2019s gonna be massive.\u201d Though it avoided the sorts of Israeli casualties that would have certainly triggered an all-out Iran-Israel war, Tehran has crossed a red line by launching the \u201cbiggest ballistic missile barrage in history\u201d against another country, Ben Taleblu added. Analysts believe that on the whole, Tehran has sought to carefully calibrate its response to Israel\u2019s attacks, especially with a new, more moderate government led by President Masoud Pezeshkian seeking to reopen nuclear negotiations with the United States in return for lifting sanctions. Pezeshkian\u2019s vice president for strategic affairs, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was Iran\u2019s chief negotiator on the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Though Tuesday\u2019s missile attack involved more firepower\u2014entirely composed of some 180 ballistic missiles fueled by higher-grade solid propellant\u2014and giving fewer hours\u2019 notice than the April attack, it was also clear that Tehran sought to preserve the balance of its huge arsenal, said to be about 3,000 missiles. Iran also tried to make the case\u2014as it did in April\u2014that the cycle of escalation should now end. \u201cEssentially, Tehran is signaling to Israel that it would be fine with limited exchanges aimed at military targets,\u201d said Hussein Banai, a scholar at Indiana University and co-author of Republics of Myth: National Narratives and the U.S.-Iran Conflict. \u201cSo if Israel hits back in a similar fashion, then I think Khamenei and co. will be happy to leave it there. But this is a critical decision point for [Netanyahu]. If he chooses to go beyond the scale of the Iranian attack in retaliation to [Tuesday\u2019s] missile attacks from Tehran, then it could force Tehran\u2019s hand to abandon its strategy of controlled escalation.\u201d Still, the Biden administration may have more leverage on this issue than it had against Israel\u2019s operations along its borders. A wider war with Tehran would require far more U.S. military and intelligence cooperation. And many within Israel\u2019s national security apparatus are wary of overconfidence and hubris\u2014especially knowing that the job against Hamas and Hezbollah is far from finished. \u201cThese are experienced, thoughtful, and sober professionals,\u201d Novik said. \u201cThey know how powerful we are\u2014but know the limits of our power. Also, unlike Netanyahu, they have nothing but respect for the U.S. defense establishment, appreciation for the unprecedented help extended by the Biden administration, and take seriously the need to coordinate closely with Washington on matters affecting U.S. national security.\u201d On Wednesday, Biden told reporters that he wouldn't support an Israeli strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. He said the United States and its Western allies are mulling new sanctions against Iran, though U.S. officials say they also expect some kind of Israeli military response. \u201cWe will be discussing with the Israelis what they are going to do,\u201d Biden said, adding that he and the other G-7 leaders \u201cagree that they have a right to respond but they should respond in proportion. \u2026 We are giving them advice. I will talk to [Netanyahu] relatively soon.\u201d The coming days and weeks will tell whether that advice takes or a bigger war ensues.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Israel\u2019s vowed reprisals on Iran, and likely escalation afterward, have jolted complacent energy markets.",
                    "post_content": "All eyes are on the scale and scope of Israel\u2019s promised response to Iran\u2019s large-scale missile barrage on Tuesday. Few eyes are watching more warily than those in the oil market, which is getting unsettling hints that Iran\u2019s oil industry, if not Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, could be on the target list for Israeli reprisals. U.S. President Joe Biden fueled that speculation on Thursday, when he answered a question about Israel\u2019s plans to potentially attack Iran\u2019s oil facilities by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re discussing that.\u201d He seemed dismissive of the idea, but he didn\u2019t outright reject it the way he had the day before regarding a strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear installations. Within minutes of Biden\u2019s comments on Thursday, oil prices shot up. Brent crude, the global benchmark, soared to nearly $78 a barrel, up more than 5 percent for the day, after largely shrugging off the kind of intensifying war in the Middle East that used to give oil traders the tremors. Ever since Hamas launched a massive attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, unleashing what would become a two-front campaign of missile strikes and ground incursions, energy markets have been the dog that didn\u2019t bark. Months of open and intense combat between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and more recently between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as a pair of direct confrontations between Israel and Iran, have left oil markets entirely nonplussed: Crude remains cheaper than it was one year (or even two years) ago. And that insouciance continued despite a relentless campaign by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have all but closed the Red Sea to commercial shipping and even attacked several oil tankers. Much of that can be explained by the fact that the oil market is well-supplied: OPEC+, the cartel of big oil-producing countries including Russia, has worked to cap its own production to keep prices from falling even lower thanks to lackluster global demand for crude. That frothy market also explains much of the lassitude oil markets have shown even amid a widening war in recent days. \u201cThe geopolitical risk premium for oil isn\u2019t dead, but it is dormant. A year of conflict hasn\u2019t really taken barrels off the market yet,\u201d said Matthew Reed, vice president of Foreign Reports, a consulting firm focused on the Middle East. \u201cCombine countless false alarms and a slack market, and you get complacency.\u201d But that may be about to change. An Israeli attack on Iranian oil facilities could mean different things. The ultimate impact will depend on what, if anything, Israel strikes; what reprisals, if any, Iran conducts; and how other big global oil producers respond to the likely shock. \u201cIf there is an intent to include energy infrastructure in a strike package, one of the things to be weighed are options that would primarily impact the domestic Iranian market, versus certain options like oil-export terminals, which could have much more impact on the global market, and much wider ramifications,\u201d said Richard Bronze, co-founder and head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a research consultancy based in London. For instance, an all-out strike on Kharg Island, the epicenter of Iran\u2019s oil-export trade, would poleax Iran\u2019s ability to earn much-needed revenue from the bulk of its 1.7 million barrels a day in oil exports, but at the cost of spiking oil (and gasoline) prices for everybody else, including Americans just weeks away from a pivotal election. More targeted Israeli strikes on refinery complexes that produce gasoline for the Iranian domestic market would hurt Tehran in the short term, but they wouldn\u2019t have the same blowback effect on global markets. An attack on Kharg Island would, at least in the near term, likely curtail Iran\u2019s ability to export most of its crude production, though Iran has the ability to ship by pipeline some crude to alternate oil-export terminals on the Sea of Oman. (Iran is reportedly already getting its tankers far away from Kharg.) Iran isn\u2019t a normal oil exporter\u2014it remains under Western sanctions\u2014and most of its crude goes to China, but any missing barrels would still be felt by the market. ClearView Energy Partners, an energy research consultancy, estimated that such a strike could send crude prices into the mid-$80s per barrel. A less ambitious Israeli strike could target Iran\u2019s domestic refining complexes, such as the modernized facility at Abadan, the oldest refinery in the Middle East. The target there would be refined products like gasoline, whose loss would be felt more by the Iranian public\u2014already bracing for Carter-era cosplays with long gas lines\u2014than by Western or Asian oil-consuming nations. The second big question is what, if anything, Tehran would do in response to a direct attack on either its financial lifeline or its domestic stability. There are several potentially vulnerable oil facilities in the region that Iran could strike in turn, though there are few viable energy-sector targets in Israel itself. Oil installations in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states could be a target for Iranian attacks\u2014the massive Saudi oil-processing facility at Abqaiq got whacked in 2019 by either Houthi drones or Iranian missiles\u2014which could exacerbate the impact of any oil-price shock at the cost of widening an already metastasizing war. \u201cThere is a lot of important energy infrastructure across the region, and it is very hard to defend it against asymmetric attacks\u2014you don\u2019t have the kind of Israeli multilayered air-defense net right across the region,\u201d Bronze said. For Iran, as has been true for decades, the most desperate option would be to try to close the vital Strait of Hormuz, the watery chokepoint at the bottom of the Persian Gulf that is the conduit for one out of every four barrels of crude shipped in tankers. That is how Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia get much of their oil to market, and its closure would be potentially devastating. ClearView estimated a prolonged closure of Hormuz, by mines or missiles, could send prices to near $100 a barrel. Iran has threatened to close Hormuz so often for so long that its threats, even recent ones, are often discounted. \u201cShutting the strait\u2014or attempting to\u2014is the nuclear option. It would be suicidal. It would be tantamount to a declaration of war on the global economy, on its neighbors, and on friends including China, which buys most of Iran\u2019s oil,\u201d Reed said. But two things might be different now. First, if Israel were to destroy Iran\u2019s own export capacity, a closure of the strait would be less self-defeating and less of a desperate move than it would have been in the past. Second, the Houthis have shown how even a ragtag band of militants can shut down a vital shipping lane with relatively unsophisticated equipment; Iran\u2019s missiles, drones, mines, and ships would potentially present an even bigger threat to a waterway that doesn\u2019t have an alternative outlet, as the Red Sea and Suez Canal do. Of course, Iran and its oil industry don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, especially in an oil market that is fundamentally well-supplied. On paper, big producers such as Saudi Arabia have plenty of spare oil-production capacity that they could call on to better any shortfall of Iranian barrels and keep prices from hyperventilating. In practice, even most barrels from Saudi Arabia would have to go through the Strait of Hormuz, and the country is not eager to get into the middle of a dispute between Israel and Iran after making peace with Iran last year. And especially after spending the past year working to keep the market as tight as possible to prop up oil prices, big producers such as Saudi Arabia would likely be leery of moving too quickly to plug any potential holes in the market. Spare capacity would only be used to balance the oil market once it got well and truly unbalanced\u2014which means there could be a bumpy ride in the meanwhile. \u201cThere is quite a lot of spare capacity on the sidelines, but it\u2019s not a question of how much or how quick, but what are the conditions in which the decision would be made to activate it,\u201d Bronze said. \u201cThere is this view that spare capacity should be a response to a supply loss, rather than preemptive.\u201d",

                    "post_content": "On Monday, the world marked one year since Hamas inflicted the worst attack on Israel since its founding. But amid remembrances for those who died on Oct. 7, 2023, there is growing concern about Israel\u2019s retaliations in Gaza and Lebanon, the rising death toll in those places, and the possibility of an even bigger conflict against Iran. One year on, where do things stand, and where are they headed? I spoke with Aaron David Miller to reflect on changes in the Middle East since Oct. 7. Miller is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and previously served in the U.S. State Department, where he advised several Republican and Democratic administrations on the Middle East. Subscribers can watch the full discussion on the video box atop this page or listen to the free podcast. What follows here is a condensed and edited transcript. Ravi Agrawal: On the one hand, today marks a year since Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel and the massive trauma of that. On the other hand, it also marks the start of a new trauma for large populations in Gaza and Lebanon. Personally, I\u2019ve been struck over the last year by how it is difficult for so many people to reflect the pain on each side, to show empathy, to humanize these traumas. To some degree, the mix of protests and memorials around the world right now reflects the spectrum of this reality. So before we really get into specifics, I wanted to give you an opportunity to open with your reflections one year on from Oct. 7. Aaron David Miller: I\u2019ll never forget\u2014I was woken by CNN on Oct. 7. And since that moment, I\u2019ve tried to default to the position of analyst. I\u2019ve also tried to hold in my head and in my heart the suffering, pain, and trauma of Hamas\u2019s terror surge on Oct. 7 and the Israeli response to the degree that is humanly possible for someone who is not an Israeli and not a Palestinian. My critics may disagree with that. I don\u2019t play an Israeli or Palestinian on TV. Both working on these issues and now trying to analyze them, I\u2019ve long tried to understand that people have two choices. You can make a judgment that you\u2019re going to root for one side or the other. Or you can acknowledge the reality that this conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s definition of a tragedy. It\u2019s two competing justices. It will be resolved or won\u2019t be resolved based on leaders who are prepared to recognize that each side has mutual needs and requirements which need to be satisfied. I\u2019d also offer my judgment that there is no objectivity on this conflict. We are all sum totals of our experiences, of our backgrounds, of our sensitivities, of our sensibilities, and of our prejudices. What is a prejudice? It\u2019s a prejudgment. I would argue that the best you can do is make allowances for the prejudgments that you have, set them aside in an effort to try to understand the narratives and the motivations of Palestinians and of Israelis. This is critically important if we are going to ever have a chance, , to resolve and to work toward what I call a conflict-ending solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. RA: You\u2019ve written several essays for Foreign Policy in the last year, and one of them challenges the conventional wisdom that Oct. 7 changed everything in the Middle East. The case for that conventional wisdom is well known: an unprecedented attack on Israel, a regional war, direct attacks by Israel and Iran against each other. So, what is the case against? Why do you think the new Middle East, however it emerges, will look like the old one? ADM: I\u2019ve become less of a believer in transformations. Oct. 7 had historic and violent and bloody firsts that went beyond anything we\u2019ve experienced. The Israeli response went far beyond the Nakba or the Naksa\u2014the setback\u2014of 1967. You have the beginning phases of what Amos Harel called the first Israel-Iranian war, which in itself is extraordinary. When I look at this corner of the Middle East, I see the three conflicts that continue to persist: Israel versus Hamas, Israel versus Hezbollah, Israel versus Iran. None of the problems in this region pertaining to Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and Israel have been resolved. Resolution seems to be further away than ever before. Every breakthrough in the Arab-Israeli conflict (with the exception of the Abraham Accords, which belong in a different category outside of conflict zone agreements) was preceded by terror, insurgency, and war. The 1973 war ultimately laid the groundwork for two disengagement agreements between Israel and Egypt, which paved the way for Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2019s peace initiative with Israel. The 1991 Madrid peace conference was preceded by Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. And the Oslo Accords, which now lie broken, were preceded by the First Intifada as well as Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat\u2019s calculation that, in fact, there was an opening here for at least the beginning of an Israeli-Palestinian process of negotiation. It\u2019s clear that the [past year\u2019s] traumas, which went far beyond any of these, will produce pain. But the status quo changes when pain is married to gain. I think it\u2019s morally unconscionable to say that there will never be a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I occupy a tiny space on the planet for a very short period of time. I wouldn\u2019t say never. But I think the space for Israelis and Palestinians has narrowed to almost an optical zero now. And the takeaway here is going to be quite clear: Israelis and Palestinians are going to say to one another, \u201cYou know, the problem is not that we don\u2019t understand one another. The problem is that we understand one another only too well.\u201d RA: But there is another element of change here, and that is how Israel is perceived around the world. There\u2019s also the element of how the United States is perceived around the world and the blow to its soft power for supporting Israel this past year. It has faced accusations of double standards in how it perceives what\u2019s going on in the Middle East versus, say, the war in Ukraine. How are you looking at that aspect of this? ADM: The international response to Oct. 7 and, very quickly, to Israel\u2019s prosecution of war has created a situation that Israel has never experienced before. Will the Israeli brand recover? Will Israel be now forever identified as an outlier in the international community, a pariah among nations? But while Oct. 7 and the Israeli prosecution of the war reached a new level, is that a headline, Ravi, or is it a trend line? I\u2019m not sure I can answer that question. I could speak more authoritatively on the U.S.-Israeli relationship. The question I get asked most frequently is why the Biden administration has been reluctant and/or refused to impose a single cost on Israel that normal humans would regard as sustained pressure. The takeaway is that the U.S.-Israeli operating system continues to operate normally. Below that, there are three critical elements for a nation to be an ally of the United States without treaty obligations, and we have no treaty obligation with the Israelis. One is a high coincidence of values. A second is a high coincidence of interest. And the third is a broad and sustainable basis of domestic support. As vibrant as the U.S.-Israeli operating system is, these three fundamentals are more fraught, more at risk, and under more stress than at any time in the 40 or 50 years that I\u2019ve been interested in and worked on this conflict. I am an advocate of a strong U.S.-Israeli relationship that is special but not exclusive. It is when the U.S.-Israeli relationship becomes exclusive that we cannot use it to the benefit of the Israelis, American interests, and Israel\u2019s peace partners. I think generational changes are afoot. I see it in my own kids and ask, is that a headline or is it a trend line? That remains to be determined. RA: Aaron, in an FP piece about the impact that the Biden administration has on Israel, you admit that the White House has leverage. But there\u2019s another component, and that is Biden\u2019s own very deep emotional commitment to Israel. I think you called him a \u201cpreternaturally pro-Israeli\u201d president. So, could a different president have done more? How would you contrast Biden with a hypothetical President Kamala Harris on this issue? ADM: It\u2019s a fascinating question. Having spent a fair amount of time in Washington around Republican and Democratic administrations, there\u2019s a notion that foreign policy is based purely on what you and I might describe as the American national interest and shouldn\u2019t be polluted or contaminated by domestic politics. The reality is that the sensibility, sensitivities, and prejudgments that a president brings to the office are so important to the way that the policy is conceived and ultimately formulated. Biden\u2019s love affair with the idea of Israel, the security of Israel, the people of Israel, is apart from the Netanyahu government. Biden began to understand midway that he was no longer dealing with the risk-averse Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He\u2019s dealing with that risk-ready Netanyahu, whose desire to be in power politics, the drive to remain prime minister, exceeds any other Israeli politician on the scene today. His capacity to do most anything to remain in power, with the constituency being not the United States, certainly not the international community, not the hostages or the hostages\u2019 families, not the 500,000 Israelis on the streets, but the 68 [seat majority of his coalition government]. Biden ultimately understood this, but it was not within his capacity to draw from the three sorts of pressure points that he could have used. He could have restricted or conditioned U.S. military assistance to Israel. He didn\u2019t do that. He could have introduced a series of U.N. Security Council resolutions critical of Israel or voted for someone else\u2019s. He didn\u2019t do that. He could have joined the 140 or so nations, including the Spanish, the Irish, and the Norwegians, in unilaterally recognizing a Palestinian state. Or he could have abandoned the whole mechanism that they tethered themselves to of an Israeli-Hamas cease-fire to de-escalate in favor of a call for the cessation of hostilities. He didn\u2019t do that. Frankly, we gave Biden the test that he could not possibly have passed. I would only point out one other thing. We do not leverage or pressure our allies. I cannot identify a single case in recent years, when a U.S. ally believed that the stakes of the struggle were politically existential or a national security risk, that the United States brought sustained and serious pressure on its ally. We\u2019re less than 30 days away from one of the most consequential elections in modern U.S. history, and people are still asking me, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the United States stop this? Why doesn\u2019t the United States suspend its military assistance to Israel now that it\u2019s expanded its campaign to Lebanon?\u201d And I just don\u2019t know where to begin to answer this question because I\u2019ve answered it so many times and it seems so foundational if you look at the way we are constructed. RA: What would a President Harris do differently? How much do we know about what her views are on Israel and Palestine? And if you have a President Donald Trump three months from now, how does that change things? You said the United States has never effectively pressured its allies, but Trump did exactly that, if you look at the pressure he put on NATO by threatening to pull out. He adds a layer of unpredictability that could upend much of what you\u2019re describing. ADM: Well, he does, when it comes to easy lifts with respect to alliance management, when it comes to issues that play well with the Trump base: America First. How long that would last under a Trump administration is unclear to me. I see Trump continuing the sugar high that he created for the Israelis between 2016 and 2020 with one exception, and that is the ATM machine that the Trump administration believes is Saudi Arabia. If Trump thought that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was actually inclined to pursue a normalization agreement with Israel and what was standing in the way was Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to recognize or acknowledge Palestinian statehood, I could see a moment of friction and tension there. But other than that, I see very little to convince me that should Trump win, it wouldn\u2019t be more or less the same as 2016. Harris is another story. Should she win, it won\u2019t be the second Biden administration. It\u2019ll be the first Harris administration. Governing\u2019s about choosing. She will inherit the same grinding conflict and the same Israeli prime minister that seems to prize his own constituency above, for sure, the interests of its closest U.S. ally. How would she deal with this? I think there\u2019s a generational difference. She\u2019s not going to describe herself as a Christian Zionist. She\u2019s not going to say that if there was no Israel, we\u2019d have to create one. She\u2019s certainly not going to say, \u201cBibi, I don\u2019t agree with a damn thing you say, but I love you\u201d anyway,\u201d as Biden has. Would she break with the operating system and risk a political backlash? It\u2019s awkward. It\u2019s messy. It can be politically costly. I think she understandably has a greater sensitivity to Palestinian suffering. I just don\u2019t think what she\u2019s going to inherit will allow her to capitalize on the kinds of opportunities that, if discreet pressure were applied and necessary, she\u2019d be able to provide. That\u2019s where the United States has actually succeeded, when an American president was prepared to fight with the Israelis and their domestic constituencies in the United States. So unless the fight with Israel could actually produce something, I think a Harris administration is likely to go to great lengths to avoid an open break or breach with the Netanyahu government. RA: A subscriber question now. This is from Gary Ostrower, and he asks, \u201cGenocide? Or not genocide?\u201d Where do you fall? ADM: I mean, genocide \u2026 I don\u2019t know what the exact definition of the 1948 Genocide Convention was for the term. The willful intentional destruction of an entire people, literally. An effort to extinguish their culture, their language, physically, psychologically, to end an entire people, to\u2014for example\u2014deport the entire Jewish community of Rhodes, Italy, 1,200 miles from the Third Reich. Is what the Israelis did genocide in in Gaza? No. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s genocide. The gap between genocide and the destruction that Israel\u2019s prosecution of this war has caused\u2014scores of thousands of Palestinian civilians killed. And children. Some 40,000 or 50,000 children injured. The obliteration of entire families. The destruction of a society and its institutions. Is that genocide? I don\u2019t think so. Maybe there\u2019s another name for it in this debate, as the other terms that have emerged during the course of this conflict, to divide instead of bring people together. I think this is about the future. And I think we have to figure out a way, if we can, to hold in our heads and hearts the futures, the pains, the hopes, the traumas, and the sufferings of both Israelis and Palestinians. Do I believe that a two-state solution is still possible? Do I believe that separation through negotiations can create a conflict-ending solution that Israelis and Palestinians would accept? Yes. I\u2019ll say it again and again and again. I do believe. It requires the one thing that has been missing from this conflict. It is the one thing that has always been present when\u2014in effect, Israelis and Palestinians, and Arabs and Israelis\u2014have managed to come together. And that is leadership. Leaders who are masters of their political houses, not prisoners of their ideologies. Leaders who are not extractive. They really do care about giving more than taking. And leaders who are prepared to recognize that the so-called other has legitimate needs and requirements that need to be satisfied. The reality is, you can\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of us. And history bends in ways that none of us can predict. We can sit back and complain and whine and moan. Or we could basically argue that we all have a responsibility to try to bend the arc in the right direction. I was in Jerusalem on Oct. 6, 1973 [when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel]. Within four years of that trauma, I watched on the White House lawn as Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, U.S. President Jimmy Carter, and Sadat signed a full treaty of peace. And I was sitting on the White House lawn when the first Oslo Accord was signed on Sept. 13, 1993, convinced that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was over. In the first instance, trauma turns to hope. In the second, hope turns to trauma. But it shows you that making predictions, pronouncements in the face of history\u2019s exigencies, and the way that it bends to and fro? None of that makes any sense. The only thing that matters is, what are you going to do about it?",

                    "post_excerpt": "The Hamas leader\u2019s demise closes the first act of the war and sets up what comes next.",
                    "post_content": "Almost a quarter century after 9/11 and the start of what became known as the war on terrorism, there is a well-worn script for the death of a major terrorist: News reports suggest a successful strike, a president or prime minister confirms the killing, there is much public joy over evil\u2019s demise, and, finally, experts speculate about the implications of the strike. States\u2014with enough time and resources\u2014invariably get their men, and the house always wins. In the long run, though, the track record of decapitation is more mixed. New leaders step up, and the wars continue. Such was the cycle for the pantheon of notorious figures\u2014including al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Islamic State of Iraq emir Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, and, most prominently, al Qaeda leader and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden. And so far, the fallout from the death of Hamas leader and Oct. 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar in Gaza seems to hew closely to this narrative\u2014including a litany of punditry about the implications of Sinwar\u2019s demise and initial indications that war will continue for quite some time to come. And so, perhaps, it\u2019s unsurprising that most commentators downplayed Sinwar\u2019s death, saying some variant of \u201ckilling Sinwar changes nothing.\u201d But that\u2019s not entirely true. To be sure, Sinwar\u2019s death won\u2019t end the Israel-Hamas war, much less the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But it will impact the war and conflict in three profound ways. First, while Sinwar\u2019s death cannot end the war by itself, it is a necessary condition for bringing it to a close. For better or worse, people tend to personalize their wars. World War II is embodied by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler,\u00a0the Iraq war by Saddam Hussein, 9/11 by Osama bin Laden, and so on. And for many, Oct. 7 is forever linked to the scowling face of Sinwar. Such personalization may not be entirely warranted. Hamas, after all, is a large and sophisticated organization; according to Israeli authorities, as many as 6,000 operatives had their hands in the atrocities of Oct. 7. But Sinwar, for better or worse, was the public face of the attack. And so, it\u2019s hard to imagine Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu\u2014or any other Israeli premier, for that matter\u2014ending the war with Sinwar on the loose, just as it would have been nearly impossible for a U.S. president to declare an end to the global war on terrorism with bin Laden still on the run. At the same time, Sinwar\u2019s death offers a chance to achieve the other necessary condition for ending the war\u2014the release of the remaining Israeli hostages. According to U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Sinwar\u2019s death removed a \u201cmassive obstacle.\u201d Whether Sinwar\u2019s absence will unstick the stalled negotiations remains to be seen, but the death of a leader is historically one of the catalysts for ending seemingly intractable conflicts. Second, and more concretely, Sinwar\u2019s death increases the chances of a more atomized, less coherent war in Gaza going forward. His death marks the culmination of an effective, brutal, and systematic destruction of Hamas\u2019s organizational structure from the political level to the tactical roots. Israel had already killed several Hamas leaders: political chief Ismail Haniyeh, deputy political chief Saleh al-Arouri, military commander Mohammed Deif, and deputy military commander Marwan Issa, among countless other members of Hamas\u2019s old guard. On the operational level, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed to have killed 8 brigade commanders, 30 battalion commanders, and over 100 platoon commanders. A large number of Hamas\u2019 soldiers are dead, as well. Killing Sinwar, then, leaves Hamas with a potential power vacuum in Gaza. The two possible successors mentioned most often\u2014Khaled Mashal, the group\u2019s former political chief, and Khalil al-Hayya, a member of the group\u2019s political bureau\u2014are both based in Qatar. For the time being, Hamas will be run by a committee that includes Mashal, al-Hayya, and other members also based in Qatar. That leaves Mohammed Sinwar, Yahya Sinwar\u2019s younger brother, who reportedly took over for Deif as military commander in July. Whether Mohammed Sinwar has his brother\u2019s charisma and can unify Hamas as an organization\u2014especially given its losses at all levels of command and continued Israeli military pressure\u2014remains to be seen. And because Hamas\u2019s structure has changed, the war in Gaza will change, as well. Israel may never wipe Hamas \u201coff the face of the earth,\u201d as Netanyahu pledged, but it has effectively reduced Hamas from a cohesive paramilitary organization with the size and capabilities of some smaller European militaries to a loosely affiliated, decentralized guerrilla group operating in the shadows for its own survival.\u00a0That means Hamas likely won\u2019t have the organizational backbone to conduct large-scale attacks against Israel on par with Oct. 7 any time soon. However, that also means that Hamas may lack the organizational coherence to negotiate a large-scale hostage-for-prisoner swap or agree to full cease-fire. From here on out, the war in Gaza will likely be fought as a series of local battles and potentially locally negotiated cease-fires. Third, Sinwar\u2019s death\u2014at least symbolically\u2014closes the first act of this war and sets up what comes next. Even before his death, Israel\u2019s strategic focus had shifted northward to Hezbollah in Lebanon and increasingly eastward toward Iran. Without Hamas as its most recognizable villain, Israel\u2019s strategic reprioritization will likely accelerate. While Israel will continue to operate in Gaza\u2014at least so long as its reported 100 or so hostages remain unaccounted for\u2014that\u2019s not the story that will dominate the headlines in Israel or around the globe. At the same time, this sets up the next phase of the broader conflict in the region. Sinwar is the latest name on the growing list of dead leaders of Iranian proxy groups, a list that now includes not only Hamas\u2019 leadership but much of Hezbollah\u2019s high command, as well. That\u2019s significant because the man who built much of Iran\u2019s proxy network, Qassem Soleimani, is dead, too. Stripped of proxies, Iran\u2019s war with Israel, long confined to the shadows, will burst into the open. At the same time, Sinwar\u2019s death\u2014or more accurately the reaction to it\u2014highlights the increasing divide across the region and the globe. Arab states were largely muted in their response, although one Saudi TV station had its Iraq office looted after it called Sinwar and late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah terrorists. By contrast, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u00a0paid tribute to them. The divisions did not stop there. Many Western leaders\u2014even critics of the Israeli government\u2014saw Sinwar\u2019s demise as both just and as an opportunity for peace. By contrast, the Kremlin, which welcomed Hamas leaders in the weeks after Oct. 7, expressed its \u201cdeep concerns\u201d over Sinwar\u2019s death, while China Daily ran a story under the headline \u201cSinwar killing seen detrimental to truce.\u201d In a nutshell, Sinwar\u2019s death became a sort of global geopolitical litmus test\u2014with the United States and most of its allies on one side and many of its foes on the other. This last point, above all, highlights why Sinwar\u2019s death matters and why this incident differs from killing al-Zarqawi, al-Baghdadi, and even bin Ladin. The Israel-Hamas conflict is not just a war against a militant group or another iteration of the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It has become a proxy for a host of other competing geopolitical forces shaping the Middle East and, indeed, the globe. It just took one dead terrorist to bring that proxy war into sharper relief.",

                    "post_excerpt": "The U.S. president wants a truce more than Israel and Hamas do.",
                    "post_content": "Woody Allen once quipped that 80 percent of success in life is just showing up. From a negotiator\u2019s perspective, he was only half right; success more often than not depends on showing up at the right time. Anyone trying to make sense of U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s tortured attempt to sell Israel\u2019s peace plan needs to take a hard look at time and timing and how each of the three major players calculate it. In essence, we have three separate clocks ticking at different relative rates. Two of those clocks belong to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar; they are set for delay and obfuscation. The third rests on the fireplace mantle in the Oval Office; it runs fast, gears meshed with urgent political exigencies. Right now\u2014and perhaps for the foreseeable future\u2014these three clocks are out of sync. And the prospects for coordinating them are dim. Indeed, for Netanyahu and Sinwar, time is an ally. For Biden, time is an enemy ticking down against an Israel-Hamas war that he\u2019s desperate to end and has little immediate prospect of doing so. Even if the two sides manage to commit to some version of the comprehensive plan put forth by Biden and Netanyahu, it\u2019s more than likely that they\u2019ll only be able to implement the first phase. With less than zero mutual trust, even that would be nothing short of a small miracle. Based on our experience, Middle East negotiations tend to have two speeds\u2014slow and slower. And these are not traditional negotiations. The principal Palestinian decision-maker is entombed somewhere in Gaza, or possibly Egypt; neither of the two leaders has any confidence that the other will comply with an agreement, no matter how limited; and the negotiations are being carried out indirectly by parties\u2014the United States, Israel, Qatar and Egypt\u2014whose goals are not always strictly aligned. The inconvenient reality is that the two leaders making the real decisions are in no hurry to make the tough compromises required for war termination. Indeed, one of our bosses, former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, used to call this kind of negotiation \u201cdead cat diplomacy,\u201d where the goal was less to reach an accord and more to ensure that if the negotiations failed, the responsibility\u2014the dead cat\u2014would be left at the other\u2019s doorstep. To complicate matters, there is no unitary Hamas. As in other such conflicts\u2014the Syrian civil war, for example\u2014two organizations have evolved. One is outside of the combat zone, outward facing, and, at least on the organization chart, the leadership. The other is inside, at the coalface, doing the fighting. Gradually, the perspectives and interests of these cadres diverge, and the outsiders\u2019 control over the conduct of the war erodes. The fight becomes the prerogative of the insiders. The tail wags the dog. Israel, Qatar, Egypt, and the United States deal with the outsiders, who can promise perfume but deliver only cordite. The key insider, Sinwar, has two clocks. The first registers the time that it will take for a combination of forces\u2014American, international, domestic Israeli\u2014to pressure Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire that leaves Sinwar himself alive and able to claim control of Gaza without fear of renewed Israeli attack. This would, indeed, be a historic victory for Hamas despite the horrific cost. As of now, it looks as though Sinwar\u2019s clock will run out faster than Netanyahu\u2019s. But Sinwar has talked of another clock, one that is more Dali than Big Ben. This is a clock that never runs out, because it displays the infinite time frame of an Israeli occupation of Gaza, which will bleed Israel diplomatically, militarily, and financially\u2014forever. At this stage, it looks as though Sinwar is prepared to shift, and in his fevered dreams perhaps, even to oversee the switch from the first clock to the second. Netanyahu is no ordinary Israeli leader. Now the longest-governing prime minister in Israel\u2019s history, he\u2019s also been on trial for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust for four years running in a Jerusalem district court. To have any chance of avoiding a conviction or a plea deal that would drive him out of politics, he must stay in power. And right now, that means keeping the most extremist government in Israel\u2019s history afloat. Having presided over one of the two worst intelligence failures in Israel\u2019s history, and the single bloodiest day for Jews since the Holocaust, he cannot end the war without a major victory. And he can\u2019t maintain the support of his extremist ministers by conceding that Hamas will somehow survive to play a role in postwar Gaza, or endorse the return of the Palestinian Authority or a Palestinian state, the price that the Saudis and Americans expect him to pay for normalization with Saudi Arabia. Even though the three-stage proposal that Biden outlined and delivered to Hamas via Qatar is an Israeli proposal blessed by the war cabinet, Netanyahu knows that it would never gain the approval of his two extremist ministers. But Netanyahu can always pivot. Yair Lapid, who heads the second-largest party in the Knesset, Yesh Atid, has offered him a \u201csafety\u201d net should the two extremist ministers bolt. More likely, Netanyahu will play for time, hoping that Hamas\u2019s response to the cease-fire proposal is a deal-breaker. Based on the U.S. reaction to Hamas\u2019s changes, he may be right. The Knesset goes into summer recess on July 25 and doesn\u2019t reconvene until October. If he can hang on until then without a coalition crisis, who knows what might happen\u2014another hostage rescue; death of Hamas senior leaders; or perhaps the election of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Biden\u2019s main challenge is political. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago kicks off on August 19; the election is a mere five months away, and voters have typically made their decision by Labor Day. Biden\u2019s clock, therefore, looks more like an egg timer. And independent voters and soccer moms, the two constituencies that he needs to win over, favor Israel\u2019s side in the conflict, while his volatile base is rooting for the Palestinians. Gaza, of course is not the only item on many of the voters\u2019 minds and is certainly not the most important\u2014with the exception of groups such as Arab Americans and possibly first-time voters for whom Trump is an unappetizing alternative. But it can take the air out of the room just when Biden really needs it. Yet his lack of leverage over Sinwar consigns him to a forlorn attempt to persuade Netanyahu to accept some kind of truce arrangement that will keep things relatively quiet for at least four or five months. For this, Netanyahu will demand a high price. Is there a way out? Right now, Netanyahu and Sinwar have created a strategic cul-de-sac for the administration. Even if Biden succeeds in persuading Hamas and Israel to accept the three-stage plan, it\u2019s more than likely that one or both will break their commitments and not get beyond phase one\u2014a limited hostage-for-prisoner exchange and temporary cease-fire. Netanyahu could probably sell this to his government, and Biden would jump at the chance of even six weeks of calm, hoping that after such a prolonged period, the pressures to end the war might grow. But even if Hamas agreed, none of the core issues that are required for war termination would be settled: Hamas would retain hostages; no capable Palestinian governing structure would be created; and no security architecture that would satisfy Israel\u2019s requirements would take hold, thus guaranteeing that Israeli military ops would continue at some level. Maybe events unforeseen will surprise, as often happens in this part of the world. But... our experience suggests that surprises will arrive in the form of unanticipated mayhem and tragic ironies.",

                    "post_excerpt": "Possible ICC warrants are the latest indicators.",
                    "post_content": "If Israel needed any more evidence that it is rapidly turning into an international pariah because of the Gaza war, International Criminal Court Prosecutor Karim Khan provided it on Monday when he said that he was seeking arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The fact that Khan was also seeking warrants for Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Deif might offer some solace for Israel and its supporters in that Hamas won\u2019t be able to escape from its alleged war crimes. But moral equivalency with a militant organization is hardly flattering. And, much more importantly, the impact of an arrest warrant has far greater implications for Israel. Apart from getting arms from Iran and cash from Qatar, Hamas doesn\u2019t have much to do with the outside world. Sinwar and Deif are presumably holed up in a tunnel somewhere deep under Gaza and aren\u2019t going anywhere; Haniyeh is a resident of Qatar and travels only to countries that do not belong to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and therefore won\u2019t threaten him with arrest. Gaza, meanwhile, remains blockaded. By contrast, Israel is deeply engaged with the world through trade, investment, and travel as well as via cultural, academic, and scientific ties. An ICC warrant would not only crimp Netanyahu\u2019s travel plans and put him into the unsavory company of previous ICC defendants\u2014such as Libya\u2019s Muammar al-Qaddafi and Sudan\u2019s Omar al-Bashir\u2014it would also cast a dark shadow over the entire country. Israel would be the first Western democracy with the moral stain of being led by a fugitive from the international law. The ICC affair illustrates, in a nutshell, the challenges that Israel faces as its nearly eight-month-old war in Gaza comes under growing international criticism. That criticism has spurred a popular movement in much of the West to isolate Israel, if not economically, then psychologically and morally via academic and artistic boycotts. Will ICC arrest warrants enable the anti-Israel drive to significantly widen its base and gain unstoppable momentum? Will public opinion turn unremittingly hostile to Israel? Will multinational corporations and investors, for instance, decide that the warrants make Israel untouchable? Will governments impose economic sanctions? Given how unprecedented the ICC threat is, it\u2019s hard to answer any of these questions right now. What can be said with far more certainty is that Israel is more vulnerable to even the mildest forms of boycotts, sanctions, and divestment than any of the other countries that have come into the ICC\u2019s crosshairs. Israel is a wealthy country but a small one, whose domestic market cannot justify producing at home most of what it needs, whether it is automobiles or the oil to run them, construction steel, or smartphones. Foreign trade accounts for a significant 61 percent of gross domestic product. The import substitutions that Russia and Iran, two much bigger sanctioned countries, have carried out with varying degrees of success, would be a nonstarter for Israel. Over most of the past decade, foreign direct investment has exceeded 4 percent of GDP, well above the average rate for members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The high-tech sector, which has been the engine of Israeli economic growth for the better part of two decades and has become its national brand, can only exist as part of a globalized economy. Over the past three years, foreign capital has accounted for three-quarters of total investment in Israeli start-up companies. Israeli tech companies are entirely focused on overseas markets, and the biggest of them are publicly traded on Wall Street. When U.S. President Joe Biden threatened in mid-May to halt the supply of some weapons to Israel if it invaded Rafah, Netanyahu vowed that Israel would fight with its \u201cfingernails. \u2026 If we must stand alone, we will stand alone.\u201d But it is an empty promise. As large and technologically sophisticated as Israel\u2019s arms industry is, it could never fulfill the country\u2019s needs for basics such as fighter jets, submarines, and bombs. The war against Hamas in Gaza, which has eaten up prodigious amounts of ammunition supplied by the United States, has only heightened that reliance. If it ends up confronting Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel will need even more U.S. arms. Even a limited economic and/or arms boycott would pose a serious threat to Israel. But, to date, it has not come close to facing one. Instead, Israel has had to contend with calls for boycotts and sanctions that have emerged in their most powerful form on college campuses and in artistic and literary circles, such as PEN America. Yet, for all the media attention they have earned, these campaigns have had little impact. Only about 12 institutions of higher education have struck deals with pro-Palestinian protest leaders, including demands for divestment from companies doing business with the Israeli military or government, but none of the universities and colleges have made any firm commitments. Unless the protests resume after summer break with the same urgency, and the legal and institutional obstacles are overcome, their demands are likely never to be implemented. A more serious threat is arising from a quieter but much more effective boycott of Israeli academics as well as Israeli artists and writers by their peers. The Israeli academic community is just as globalized as its high-tech sector, and it will struggle to contend in a world where research papers are turned down by journals, scholars are unwelcome at conferences, and access to grants and fellowships is blocked. There are reports that this is happening already. In the same vein, some Israeli writers have been censored (most prominently, Joanna Chen, whose essay on the Gaza war was pulled from the literary magazine Guernica), and some Israeli artists have seen performances and exhibitions canceled. Israeli artists and writers may not need the entire world as much as academics, but the psychological blow has been enormous\u2014especially since, as a group, they tend to see themselves as critics of their own government. But it is doubtful whether Israel\u2019s critics will be able to widen their campaign into a far-reaching consumer or business boycott. Public opinion just isn\u2019t anti-Israel. When the Pew Research Center polled Americans in March (about five months into the war in Gaza), 58 percent of respondents said Israel\u2019s reasons for fighting were somewhat or completely valid. Even as Palestinian casualties had reached about 32,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, more U.S. respondents found Israel\u2019s war conduct acceptable than didn\u2019t. Perhaps even more telling, more than a quarter said in response to both questions that they weren\u2019t sure, a reflection of how little of the public gives it a thought at all. Most importantly, among Americans ages 50 or older\u2014the cohort most likely to be university trustees and occupy corporate C-suites\u2014support for Israel\u2019s war effort was much higher (67 percent to 78 percent) and the share who said they weren\u2019t sure was much lower (15 percent to 22 percent). It\u2019s too early to say whether the proposed ICC arrest warrants will bring about a sea change in public opinion. More likely, they will reinforce the pro-Palestinian/anti-Israeli feelings that already exist in certain communities and enflame their moral fervor (while they ignore the fact that the charge sheet against Hamas is actually longer). For the rest, Israeli actions in Gaza have been the subject of intense media coverage since the start of the war, and it is unlikely that the ICC will be presenting any new damning evidence. What is possible\u2014but again, it is too early to say with any assurance\u2014is that some companies may look more askance at doing business with Israel. But it is official sanctions that pose the greatest danger. Governments\u2014first and foremost the U.S. government, with its ability to leverage the dollar to enforce its will around the globe\u2014have the power to impose and enforce sweeping measures in one fell swoop. But for now, it seems, Israel appears safe. The European response to Khan\u2019s announcement has been mixed but not enthusiastic, and the Biden administration has denounced\u00a0the planned arrest warrants for top Israeli officials. The longer-term outlook for Israel is less certain. Among Americans ages 18-29, support for Israel in the war is much more tepid. More hold a more favorable view of Palestinians as a people than they do of Israelis. If these opinions stay with the young as they grow older and advance to positions of power and influence (and assuming that the Israel-Palestine dynamic remains unchanged), Israel could be in for tough times. The ball in those intervening years will be in Israel\u2019s court. It has a chance to make amends\u2014if not to win over hardcore Palestinian supporters, then at least to sway the rest. Unfortunately, Israel\u2019s current government has neither the will nor the ability to do that. Its far-right component sets the tone for much of policy, especially regarding the West Bank occupation, and its leaders happily offer controversial, if not shocking, statements that provide grist for anti-Israel activists. For these far-right leaders, Israel shouldn\u2019t be wasting time worrying about what the world thinks of it. Bezalel Smotrich, the extreme right Israeli finance minister, thus dismissed Khan\u2019s announcement as just another example of \u201chypocrisy and hatred of Jews.\u201d Without a change of government, Israel may indeed be on its way to pariah status without even putting up a fight.",

                    "post_excerpt": "An execution, a prosecution, and then a backlash.",
                    "post_content": "The Israeli attack on a humanitarian convoy in Gaza in early April that killed seven aid workers with the U.S.-based aid group World Central Kitchen has ignited a fierce global backlash against Israel\u2019s policies of engagement in the territory. The attack involved the successive firing of three missiles at three vehicles, driven by suspicions of a Hamas combatant\u2019s presence within the convoy, according to reports. In Israel, the event is being portrayed as an accident, \u201ca grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to a mistaken identification, errors in decision-making, and an attack contrary to the Standard Operating Procedures,\u201d as the Israeli military\u2019s investigation team concluded. In humanitarian circles, it is seen as evidence of a culture that \u201ctreats Gaza as a free-fire zone with total impunity for gross attacks on civilians,\u201d as Jeremy Konyndyk, the president of Refugees International who served in both the Obama and Biden administrations, has suggested. But for the discussion to be useful, it should progress beyond these immediate interpretations to examine the deeper cultural patterns underlying such incidents. Most crucially, it must scrutinize the shift in military policy and ethos that can be traced back to the Elor Azaria affair of 2016-17. Azaria was an Israeli conscript who was captured on video executing a wounded and immobilized Palestinian assailant in Hebron. The Israeli military prosecuted Azaria for manslaughter and sentenced him to 18 months in prison. While the case demonstrated the military\u2019s commitment to its own ethical codes, it also sparked widespread protests from right-wing factions and a general backlash against military procedures. The army was accused of failing to support Azaria and creating a culture in which soldiers would hesitate to use force against Palestinian militants. To counter this claim, and from that point forward, the military began to announce the number of Palestinian fighters killed in its operations, demonstrating that its forces did not hesitate to engage. Under the leadership of the military\u2019s chief of staff, Aviv Kochavi, from 2019 to 2023, the killing-based criteria were reinforced. Kochavi\u2019s goal was to remake the army into a \u201clethal, efficient, and innovative\u201d fighting force\u2014in other words, a death-generating army. He promoted this vision by enhancing the precision of weapon systems, improving the coordination between forces and intelligence, and increasing the rate of fire. Kochavi\u2019s directive for field commanders to assess, at the end of each combat phase, the number of enemy forces killed and objectives destroyed\u2014rather than solely focusing on territorial conquest\u2014signified a shift toward necrotactics, where the primary goal of military engagement is killing the enemy. Killing becomes not just an outcome of warfare but its principal aim. The approach of using body counts as a metric of success has notably intensified during the current war. Soon after the Oct. 7 attack, the Israeli military began consistently reporting the number of Hamas fighters killed, echoing the way U.S. generals announced enemy fatalities during the Vietnam War\u2014a scenario where traditional metrics for evaluating combat success are elusive, thus making the body count, rather than the strategic objectives achieved, the primary indicator of success. This was particularly evident as the Israeli death toll ticked up and the stated objective of dismantling Hamas appeared increasingly unattainable. In fact, the military appears to have established a quantitative goal from the outset. According to the journalist Yuval Abraham in +972 Magazine, the Israeli army developed an artificial intelligence-based program named Lavender, designed to identify targets for assassination. This system tagged approximately 37,000 Palestinians in Gaza as suspected militants, marking their residences (and therefore their families as well) for potential airstrikes. The deployment of Lavender contributed to the deaths of around 15,000 Palestinians in the war\u2019s first six weeks, according to the report. By setting a numerical target, the Israeli military shifted from viewing outcomes as a measure of progress\u2014like neutralizing the threat posed to Israel from Gaza\u2014to making body counts the main standard. The trend has been reinforced by a pervasive adoption of the language of killing among military commanders. \u201cNow we will go forward and kill them all,\u201d Brig. Gen. Roman Goffman was quoted as saying just before the ground operation in Gaza began, in just one prominent example. As Israel faces an impasse in Gaza, lacking a politically articulated exit strategy, the reliance on killing and its quantification as a metric for success becomes increasingly pronounced, leading to the erosion of operational constraints. This shift was evident in the recent raid at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, which inflicted extensive damage to Gaza\u2019s most crucial health care infrastructure. The hunt for Hamas members has, to a significant degree, become an end in itself, complicating the dynamics of the conflict and placing military objectives above political resolutions. This shift provides some context for the tragic killing of the aid convoy team\u2014though it makes it no less disturbing. Once one or two armed individuals were spotted in the convoy, their neutralization became a top priority, apparently eclipsing overarching strategic considerations\u2014factors that should have been incorporated at the tactical level. Fundamentally, such a situation warranted an approach aimed at preventing civilian casualties, especially along a deconflicted route designated for humanitarian aid delivery and when no direct threat was posed to Israeli troops. Moreover, the overarching political rationale should have prioritized safeguarding humanitarian missions, given the potential repercussions for Israel\u2019s global standing amid the crisis in Gaza. Yet the events unfolded with a seeming obsession for lethal action, as vividly illustrated by reporting in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz: Upon spotting a gunman or two, Israeli forces targeted three successive vehicles from the air. After the first one was hit, passengers moved to a second vehicle, which was then struck by a missile. And when the wounded were transferred to a third vehicle, it too was fired on. This appears to be a case of obsessive kill confirmation, overshadowing the principles of necessity, proportionality, and the sanctity of civilian life. Hence, the fundamental issue extends beyond merely revising the rules of engagement or monitoring their application more closely, as such measures alone would prove inadequate to prevent future incidents. The problem also transcends the flawed assumption that every part of Gaza can be considered a free-fire zone where engaging Palestinian militants indiscriminately is justified. What is crucial is dismantling the prevailing culture that equates killing with military success.",
